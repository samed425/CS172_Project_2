Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* Don t feel bad. A good percentage of them have families. You are not alone. Is there a family of Karen s support group on Reddit? The best thing you can do is call her out on it when it happens around you. Don t go stop being a Karen! but rather mom it s just some ice, stop throwing a fuss. Calmly call her out, and if you re lucky she ll be embarrassed enough to stop. I really hope for you that there is no genetic predisposition to becoming a Karen Thoughts and prayers Gross, I hate your mom It s your duty to be a better example of how to treat people At least you ve identified her and can take appropriate steps Next up, see if you can identify any particular triggers she has so you can RUN I'm guessing not American because we would get upset if someone gave us a warm soda. Man, as people get older, especially Moms, they just lose their shot over the smallest things. My mom is in her mid 70 s and can make a mountain out of a molehill. My poor Dad. Yo mama is such a karen...... Being raised by a Karen sucks. Depending on your age, all you can do is look ashamed and sympathetic. Distraction is also a technique. Find her crazed Karen focus that does not involve tormenting others. Hey mom, I saw some great modern farmhouses signs online. Let s go look at those. I think we might need a love, love, laugh in the bathroom, too. There s not too much you can, just do you best to mitigate the evil and learn how not to be a Karen. Best of luck. As my mom has gotten older she s been Karen-ish, but after her stroke she s turned into a full blown one. She can say some pretty awful things. One example is she has lost the concept of time, and we can be waiting 3 minutes at a register and she thinks it s 15 and starts getting mad, and saying no one is doing their job, why don t they have more registers open, etc. She started to freak at the DMV. I ve learned to shut her down when it starts, gently but firmly, telling her to stop. It feels so weird acting like the parent to my mom. But my mom has age and medical infirmity as an excuse. And other Karen s are clearly mentally ill. The remaining Karen s are just entitled bitches who love to pick fights. Point it out to her? My mom in her old age has done a few mean things at stores. I have scolded her in front of everyone. For example there were bags on the ground as we were checking out and she kicked them as we walked by. I scolded her saying mom why would you kick them? You didn t need to make more of a problem for these people i picked the bags up. She says well I m getting old and I told her it s not their fault you re old, be kind to others . The cashiers all were smiling. She then tried to say well I m not feeling good. I told her that as we say at work your diagnosis doesn t give you the right to be mean to others. I went to visit my older sister last Summer and was horrified to discover she has become a total Karen. I was so embarrassed and would go back to where we had been to apologize profusely. A couple years ago I picked up my daughter for the weekend. Halfway through the ride she comes out with, my moms a karen . She was 7. I laughed so freakin hard!! Yes she is pretty, yes she is My mother once barged into the fast food counter after I ordered we went in together but she went to the washroom first , yelled that she was paying for me, ordered her own food, and then yelled at the cashier after he handed me my coffee saying 'I didn't order this! Why would you give me coffee?!' I just stared at her and picked it up. You are not alone. Who wants ice in their drink??? 1st world I live in a culdesac and shop and Trader Joe s issues. Yep you posted a little mishap online, you are def a Karen already gg You have to start calling her out. Preventing Karen behavior starts at home. I hwar stories of kids with mothers who are total Karen's. They seem to spend most of their time following the parent around and apologising for their behaviour to everyone Raise by narcissists? Omg I was going to ask this too lol Narcissists don t get embarrassed they redirect and blame others and punish anyone who dares to try and embarrass them. But if you know this and detach emotionally it can be rather fun to send them into a nuclear spiral of self delusion So do i I get this. When my Mom retired it s like she forgot about how other people are busy or just trying to do their jobs too. She s always in some sort of rush, like she doesn t have ALL DAY to get shit done. It s maddening. She ll even complain about the mail being a couple of hours late or the electric company not sending her bill on the day they usually do. This is the way, honestly. Embarrassment is the only thing that stops this. This and refusing to go out with them anymore and telling them why. Or you could do the are you mad because you are old, are because they are young? Give her something to think about. Pretty much every American. Uh oh, here's Karen Commenter  wow, thats new to me. Nobody here likes that, it dilutes the taste and leads to hiccups I don't get hiccups and I drink it before the ice melts. but why should the drink be cold, is it something other than instilled habit ? It's refreshing. so drinking without ice is not refreshing? Not to me and others but to each his own. I know Brits like warm soda. really? never heard this That the British don't use ice? It's an actual thing. https://www.rd.com/article/americans-love-ice-british-dont/ I think europe doesn't use ice, which means their drinks are not warm bit cold, not ice cold Yes I did hear that somewhere.",

I would like to speak to the manager. Is the hollandaise on the side? WTF IS A CAR FARMER? Is there low fat hollandaise? What kind if cheese is used? Is it shredded or sliced? I'm surprised it's not potato salad with raisins. Served with a side of rage and smothered in entitlement. Whatever the ingredients, it will taste bitter. Funnily enough the menu post was right under this on my feed. The only time I will ever want a Karen. Sounds delicious. Payment in advance for the Karen A screencap of an already posted to this sub image? so you mashed 2 reposts together, 'great' job you pathetic loser begging for fake internet points The Karen needs avocado Here s how it works. Check your meal right when you get it. If you eat it, and then complain, trying to skip, you are an asshole. You have the right to get the meal that is being advertised, not a free meal. Sounds like a group of real capital c words. That sandwich sounds pretty good though Does anyone have a picture of this dish? Noooo Is 'The Karen' personally delivered by the manager? Should have added - served to you by the manager. That actually sound delicious This is a good Karen. Like a perfect Harvest Moon Karen. Is this a repost of a screenshot of a post, or is my phone glitching? Mark Rutte entered the chat All Dutchmen are 8 tall. I blame the hollandaise! It should state that it's delivered to the table by the manager! I think it's an omelette if it makes you feel any better As an Americanman I apologize for our use of holiday sauce on such a sandwich. Everything is on the side. Yet, she ll still find a reason to speak to a manager Folks with multiple broken down cars parked in the lawn. YES, WE NEED TO KNOW THIS!!!! If you plant roller skates in the spring, you harvest cars in the fall. I had to know too! https://reddit.com/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/109yjje/_/j42pqd6/?context=1 I only do organic cars, also is the car local? I actually didn t even question that haha Is your car free roam? If I get no ham is it cheaper? maybe the sandwich is supposed to make them mad And mini marshmallows for some inexplicable reason? As a white girl from the Midwest you just unlocked a childhood trauma. I think that's what started my hatred for raisins. I thought it was a nice coincidence that the post right above it was about hollandaise sauce lol how dare you, it's Merry Christmas sauce! I want to speak to the manager Do i get a discount as a military wife? We don't acknowledge same sex marriages Karen #2",

This guy we will call him Benny would come in to pay his cellular bill and always would make rude remarks on his way out. At this point in time, I was the only one working at the store for a while and was pretty burnt out and then we finally hired another employee who worked the couple of days I had off. Anyways there was only one person working the store everyday. Part of my job is to take the deposit to the bank or back office would have a field day with me. I tried to be quick every time and put a sign up on the door saying I would be gone for maybe 20 min. Besides that I never left the store, skipped eating or taking breaks on a 10 hour shift because customers would be majorly furious about this and I agree that it was very inconvenient for them and hated this. My employee would only put the sign up when she would get food and leave and go straight back to the store also skipping a break. Well Benny came in one beautiful afternoon when I was assisting another customer. The day before he had came in to do a sim swap and him and another Karen ganged up on my employee. She called me crying while they screamed at her in the background. I hated listening to this call, it made me furious. Anyways I m helping him pay his bill when completely unprovoked he says are you always such a bitch? Sir. I kindly asked what he was talking about to which he started ranting about how sometimes he arrives to the store and the door is locked and that I sound like a robot. I have a generally monotone voice but I ve always tried to sound upbeat I explain to him that we are unfortunately short staffed and that I need to leave the store sometimes to run deposits or my rep leaving to get something for lunch. Obviously I m not happy with these conditions either and wish we had more staff but it just isn t that simple. He starts yelling at me that i should just quit if I m not happy with the understaffing like that would make his problem worse but ok? and also screaming at me to hire more people and it s ALL my fault. Like dude DUH that s what I ve been trying to do. Anyways this was kind of my breaking point because customers were constantly putting me down since working there. Only time I ve ever cried infront of customers. I ll spare some details but he basically cussed me out and called me every name in the book. The other customer I was helping before him even yelled at him to just leave because he just flipped out unprovoked and would leave for a moment but then come back in to continue screaming. How did it end? His wife made him come apologize to me. Bless her heart",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* As a former manager my favorite response to this bullshit was to let the person know we re hiring and ask if they d like to apply? Inevitably they d scoff and I would reply saying we re looking for help on evenings and weekends if they know anyone who would like those hours to let them know we re hiring! I use to work Walmart cashier like during Covid, and people complain even at me to hire more and I would say apply online their is a personality test you have to pass, also I am not a hiring person, I am a cashier. It was fun when they ask me for jobs and I would be like go to the site click careers enjoy. That s all I could do. Karen would even yell for a manager and the manager would flip around and say person I am right here then be surprised a manager was on the register right next to me. And supervisors where also up front like Karen we are all up here, pay and get out . Your directing your anger at the customer which is fair I guess but the problem is the company which is screwing him. And you. Never work for free. You get breaks. Take your breaks. Put up the sign and eat your lunch. It baffles me that people do not understand the staffing shortage and supply chain issue. It's not new. Especially in the service industry. I am a chef at a restaurant and event center and we had our Event planner and front end manager quit last week. It's a nightmare to find people You need Customer service training. How to handle rude people etc. Idiot man. He was wrong. Retail work is hard! Uk LMAO, that is golden. I wish I was that quick witted, some of these customers are characters for sure. I always say that being a manager is just extra work load, over time and getting yelled at more I used to be a part time assistant manager at jiffy lube. I'm a certified tech, I was just looking for some extra hours at a part time job, jiffy lube can't afford a real tech full time hours. Anyways, we had signs up everywhere saying we were hiring so when people got mad we couldn't help them fast enough I would always let them know they were welcome to apply as we were hiring. We are still having issues with having enough cashiers, and last night, we had a Karen upset because the one cashier had a line of 2 people, but she didn't want to wait. I got called up because, of course, she needed to talk to a manager and started going off about how we need to hire more people. I told her to apply since we needed help, and she started getting louder. At this point, I'm very burnt out and told them that we can't keep cashiers because they have to deal with people like them constantly. Unprofessional? Yes, but hey, they said they're never coming back, so yay! lol what a brilliant fucking comment Some states, like AZ do not require an employer to provide a lunch break, or even a 15 minute break in an 8 hour shift. Last time I looked up employee rights in this right-to-work state. As long as they pay you for the hours you work, no breaks are required. And then if you're salaried, not only are no breaks required, but they're not required to pay OT until you hit, I believe, 15 hours over 40-hour work week. So you work 55 hours a week at the same rate, with no breaks, and as long as you don't make waves, you can keep your job. Otherwise, as a right-to-work state, they can fire you for pretty much anything except discrimination based on race, religion, sexual preference, or disability. Welcome to customer service jobs! It isn't hard to find people if they're paid a living wage. Honestly I don t think it s that they don t understand, they just don t care. Their ass should be kissed at all costs. Especially when so many people are Covid deniers or use that as another jumping-off point to rant about people not wanting to work. Thanks and yes!! I never got trained on customer service, although I feel like I generally handle things as professionally as possible I know there s some things that need touched up on. Retail work is the worst but it s only temporary until I get into a real career! I ve also told a few Karen s that yes we are hiring, most fail the personality test or have bad availability. Life under capitalism sets the exploited against each other while the rich take everything and laugh. Yeah I ain't getting involved in that previous thread, but like you said, if you work for the type of company or people that abuse your time on technicalities or simply because they can't get/retain employees , 'just leave' is not that simple. Some people can't afford to walk out on a job. And if you have the type of service ethic where you still want to do the best you can for the customer under the circumstances you sacrifice yourself kind of a human shield . It sucks here. Oh I 100% agree pay scale plays a huge role. We are trying to find prep cooks/line cooks. It's normally $17/hr on the higher end for that job. No degree needed. We upped it to $22/hr and benefits and still cannot find anyone. But yeah I don't blame them. Most can get desk jobs that pay $25/hr no degree needed. But this was before and during Covid. Most of the newbies leave after a few months. I stuck around till I moved in with my husband, like 2 years, self check out also was the same. Karen still think they are entitled to the world and retail people are at their beck and call, we ll if it s violates policy even managers will ban you. I sow one Karen get banned and a manager followed her out to the parking lot, like we know who you are get out permanently from that particular Walmart, oh and it s a super Walmart. Fun times when they mess with the wrong people. Personality test? wow red-pilled asf Yes exactly. It s not simple as just quitting because I have bills to pay. Also i understand the original commenters point in saying I m mad at the wrong person but I completely understood his frustrations. I repeated that several times and infact it s something I still have to explain. The problem is that they are not understanding, they look at me and immediately place the blame on me and not the company. I m mad at the customer for berating me, treating me like I m not even a human being for a problem that is completely out of my control and pay grade. I would never speak to any one like that no matter how mad I am, the customer was a grown ass baby. It s mostly a strongly agree or strongly disagree test, cashier and self check out people take a test to see if they have the same company values. It s also known as a corporate personality test some companies have it. When applying for jobs. Most of the time it s a red flag. When people apply for jobs this type of test appear often to weed out people. It s a hoop you have to jump though to apply. it s annoying to do as well. Perhaps your argument is that we live in a just and equitable world? im amazed how you can say these things with such confidence and conviction but fail to understand my initial comment was scoffing at how black & white your solution to OP s problems are I was offering an explanation, not a solution. Absent a restructuring of our social and economic arrangements, there is not much an individual can do. But a person should work to contract. Don t work for free. If that s bad advice you are free to continue to happily embrace your own oppression. The customer is angry because he is paying for a service that he is not receiving. The company cuts corners, setting workers and customers against each other. But yes, your glibness and contempt are perhaps the solution. it s more than apparent that youve never been in a situation where, yes, a company is taking advantage of you but youre left with little to no other options. yes, let s take this armchair professional redditor s sage advice and explanation and lose our job. i hate resorting to insults but you re incredibly dimwitted and cant see beyond what s written and laid out in front of you. do you actually believe people *want* to work for free ? to be paid less than what they should be ? to skip out on lunch or any type of break for that matter ?? like i said, dimwitted thinking and your following responses to this are likely going to be composed of the same dimwitted thinking you ve been replying to me with Thanks for your trenchant and thoughtful comments. Really valuable and empathetic. Enjoy being you. Which seems to me punishment enough. I feel for the people subjected to you on a regular basis though. But I am hopeful that they spend most of their time being exploited at work and are not subjected at any great duration to your deep unpleasantness. So let us all go forth and never complain about the deep structural inequities in society. Instead we should just learn to be helpless and accept our fate and quickly insult anyone who points out how we are all screwed. Your aggression towards me serves as a symptom of the societal dysfunction I am attempting to describe but I would image a person like yourself would fail to grasp the irony. Or understand what irony is. Anyway, happy Saturday. I imagine you are working, in your ninth hour, eating your lunch at your cubicle while customers harangue you. This must bring you great joy as it seems to be the social order you are defending. yea bro i aint reading all that but have a nice day ! sorry my comments cut you deep you can block me but it wont make you any less of a dimwitted loser Unfortunately you have to start somewhere and for me, dealing with the short staffing, overworking, and getting berated on a day to day basis is where I have to start. It s not where I plan to be forever of course, not even for five years. Unfortunately I ve looked into other job options and it seems to pay less then what I get paid now, i mean hey, I wish I could quit! I also recognize that the company is the issue here because they re cheapskates and all, but some customers also just lack respect. I always abide by the golden rule and it doesn t kill to be understanding. It s just frustrating I suppose because while I understand their frustration they still go berserk on me like it is all entirely my fault. I know I represent the company and all but I would never treat someone the way some of these people treat me, ever. What an asshole. Bro.",

I told everyone that going into bedding aisle was a bad idea. Karens are lawful evil. They believe in laws and rules, just ridiculously unfair ones that benefit them and keep 'those people' 'where they belong.' Better be careful or Wizards of the Coast is gonna steal this and make it canon Shit scp 096 breached again There was a mod for L4D2 where they turned the witch into a screaming Karen. I can t find it anymore but it was hilarious and scary. Strength rating is way too high. These Karen's are obnoxious because they are weak. Case in point: https://youtu.be/0gAlH9ldnuY Charisma way too high Wisdom is too high. I feel like Speak to the Manager should have been a Willpower save Okay this is funny but I have a technical question about something it said. It mentions Karen can enter outrage state for one minute, in D&D games, how do you keep track of a timed based effect, wouldn't slower players negate the time? What about people who wait for the clock out? I'm interested in D&D, and read an unhealthy amount of LIT-RPG, but life circumstances hasn't made it possible for me to ever actually play. Just curious on the mechanics. Would 40 Karen's beat 40 Orcs? I wonder if anyone would actually get mad or a backlash occurs if someone put Karen's into a video game to be attacked or killed as a rare NPC or boss fight xD. Mandatory 'fuck Wizards of the Coast' 'Natural' claws They have those. They're called Harpies. I m using this Anything that annoying definitely has a lower charisma score. LMAO totally using this in my next campaign. Is that the Witch from L4D? This is awesome I would say lawful evil, but I'm snarky. Cause they always call the cops . These motherfuckers gave her a potara All I see is Dee from IASIP This sounds like a fun mini-boss Her charisma is too high. Should be -5 Ah dahm, with the new guidelines this is actually owned by the makers of DnD, so uh this is canon now This is genius! I m surprised the intelligence stat is that high I have sent this link to every gamer I know. Genius! I'm going to have to resin print a Karen. I think the wisdom/int/cha are too high Jesus. That is flat out the scariest monster I have ever seen in D&D. Karens are Lawful Evil, obviously. How often do they rely on police or managers to enforce their vicious agenda? this is very great It s a leaf lover! KILL IT! ! gif giphy MQQruhFtqZ51DdipHS RAWK AND STOWMNE It should be a summoning spell Call the Captain of the Guard. Worst add-on campaign since Spelljammer I would've gone with neutral evil. They don't actually care about or adhere to rules unless they benefit them. They're not evil with a moral code or anything, they're just pure selfishness. Came here to say this. Laws are for me, not for thee. Oh, that law doesn't agree with me? Then it's not a real law. And then sue to make sure only they get profits on it 4 fucking pixels. I'm 42 and youtube still won't let me watch age-restricted content and there support is silence. Nah it should be higher removed In game time does not pass at the same speed as real life time. As the other reply mentioned, a round in combat is 6 seconds of in game time. Depending on the number of players and monsters, it could take 15 minutes of real life time for a single round of combat. Most people don't really understand Charisma in D&D because its not particularly straight forward and the definition in the RAW only really lists the positive traits associated with it. It is NOT Exclusively a measurement of a creatures 'Attractiveness' or 'Likeability'. For what a Karen is and does, their Charisma would actually be very high. Charisma is a measure of a creatures ability to command attention and convince people to give in to their demands. Legit first thing my mind went to, specifically when they were making Lethal Weapon 7 of course. I may want one. Asking to speak to the manager should also be a summoning spell. If a successful check on her part makes the manager her thrall, possibly someone in the party to fight on her behalf. Everyone will have opinions depending on their experiences with Karens in real life, but I applaud OP for getting this out there. Call the General of the Captain of the Guard. Sam Vimes is pissed. No, they definitely care about the law. Specifically, they want to see anyone who bends the rules be punished severely besides themselves . Karen is about to speak with the manager about her royalties check Lol This. Come on in, the water is fine. I have always wanted to but unfortunately life circumstances has prevented me and my current situation isn't any better.. hopefully one day I get to a point where I am able, but that isn't looking likely for a while Interesting. Thanks for the explanation. You mean His Grace, the Duke, Captain of the City Watch, and Blackboard Monitor Vimes? But he just LOVES when stupid people insist they know him! Yeah, it's the besides themselves part that I'd say makes them neutral evil rather than lawful evil. Rolling up on school board meetings and threatening to kill board members that said kids Often not even their kids. had to wear masks is not the actions of a lawful people.",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* Id eat the shit out of The Karen. Wait, I was just on another post and Karens apparently have an aversion to hollandaise, so I say not accurate. *served by the manager* Should be in the order as, Bacon, Individual mushrooms, Tomatoes, Cheese melted , Hollandaise, Expert ham, Spinach Hollandaise should be on the side at the very least. They probably serve it without the cheese melted and just wait for the show.. Why is there avocado in a Greek omelette? The Karen isn't complete without a white whine. Is that thick cut bacon? Also Can I get no tomato and the hollandaise on the side. And can you make sure it s hot, like hot hot, not like last time ok. Nah mate a Karen would have: Tri mix of Limburger, Blue Cheese and Gorgonzola, Artichoke, Brussels sprouts, Cabbage & Radishes Yes, but make it low fat and vegan. Bacon and ham makes since, considering most Karen's feel the need to call the pigs for every inconvenience. Wtf is hollandaise? Delivered straight to your table by the manager It doesn't matter, there will always be something unforgivably wrong with the order. Only if you complain about it to the manager. Bacon is love and acceptance there is no way it can be included in 'the karen' Only if you order it and ask to speak to a manager. Is it served by the manager? Or where does the name come from??? Uh...I dunno. It sounds too delicious to be I guess. Yes. Anything with ham, sausage, bacon, and fucking carnitas is meaty AF. Yes, that is a Greek omelette. Well they have avocado in 'Greek' lol omellete so dont take them serious If only they put all the ingredients on there, and then added leaving half of them out and subbing for something else it would be PERFECT Yep, that's all the meats. Aptly named, especially with the carnitas on top. If it s accurate? dk, but It the description sounds wonderful Nah, the Karen 100% has avocado. No. A Greek Omelette needs an anchovy in it I the this is the only Karen I would actually like . I'd take that salty sandwich over the talking ones any day. Okay but The Karen sounds fire Needs way more screeching and some assault. Ok but that actually sounds delicious? I would have imagined The Karen would be 'Salt pork, served on a toasted Salt Bagel with a side of Salt and Vinegar chips' That actually sounds delicious Hollandaise a Karen, I m down, shits good. Wait, Damn, it sounds good! Well, Avocados got nothing to do with Greece Nah ! That has good ingredients. Karen's should have crappy ingredients ! I don t know if I like hollandaise so once I ve eaten it I will protest about paying for it! *comes with the wrong side sauce so that you ll have to speak to the manager The Karen also comes with one free request to speak to the manager. No guarantee that the manager has to fulfill any requests They forgot manager meat It should come with manager on the side. No thank you, I recently found out that I m not a huge fan of cooked Spinach or a lot of sauces in omelets. I cannot remember what it is from but I hear the woman s voice in my head saying sooo meaty . What show was that? Ugh that s driving me nuts and I do not want to google that phrase That's named after a elderly regular they like. She ordered that every Sunday after church back when they were trying a 'Make your own omelette!' thing with a long list of ingredients, and Karen's order happened to be so milquetoast that they could still do it without any trouble once they dropped the unpopular or labor-intensive stuff. Half the other omelettes on their menu are the same, shit people ordered all the time that they can still make, but only Karen suggested they name it after her. When she comes in on Sunday she's all 'I'd like to have tee-hee a Karen? Oh, and a latte, please, with Splenda.' Her husband, named something like Dougie or Ralphie or Mikey, thinks it's funny. He orders the 'So Meaty' or the 'Super Meat' it has one more meat in it or perhaps even the 'Cholesterol Special' which has two more meats plus Hollandaise . He also wants a side of bacon, and black coffee. For the next ninety minutes Karen and Mikey pick at their food and read the local paper. Mikey eventually finishes, sure, but Karen wants a box to put her food in. She leaves her untouched toast on the plate because she knows it doesn't reheat. Then she smacks Mikey in the arm until he leaves at least a $15 tip on the $40 bill, making them the only couple that didn't tip a Chick Tract or a single digit percentage that morning. This has nothing to do with Karens except the name. Green omelette doesn't have avocado.. js Avocado, Greek. Pick one No that sounds delicious. How about egg whites, anchovies, kale and white beans to make a Karen? That fucking bacon better be extra fucking crispy I would definitely complain about the price. No, 'The Karen,' would be a visit from the management, bit of random stuff from the trash/floor, cooked in a microwave, and seasoned with nothing. No here s what it should be. Rotten Lox with black spotted cream cheese served inside a dry, room temperature omelette. Definitely will make you want to speak to the manager every time. I remember when this sub first started. So much content. So funny. Now it's all just 'haha look it says Karen' or 'look at this 100% must-be-a-Karen because she has The Haircut'. Guys. *Guys.* Come ON. You get to speak to the manager as well. It's perfect sounds and look great but then gets you in the end lol You for got the 'Special sauce' Has a lot of ingredients so Karens can ask for substitutions, get the wrong food, and complain about it. Also hollandaise can easily go wrong so it's like a Karen trap. Avocado in a Greek omelette? Nah. As long as you order this but send it back, complain and ask to speak to the manager They should have sleeping pills and gin put in that omelette Nope. It also has to be served too cold with not enough of some ingredient and be over priced for the portion size while simultaneously being too big . Should read doesnt matter whats in it, just get the manager Not accurate. Where's the mayo? Should say 'meltdown' cheese No, it s too hard to get the hollandaise right. Fuck the Karen I want to see the whole description for The So Meaty, that thing is looking on point. Shouldn't it be dry stale bread, and under cooked egg, expired meat and too much sauce and too little cheese Nah a Karen omelet has C.heese U.nwashed spinach I know that s a stretch N.ew potatoes T.omatoes I don't see the connection. Ok that actually sounds really good that sounds nauseating. Melted Cheese, on top of the Hollandaise ? and MUSHROOMS, too ? BARRRF The Karen needs more durian  ! gif giphy 3gbJPJ8zW10SQ better hope you got room for 'the clusterfuck'. YEEHAW I literally just read the post by u/motherofredfox and now see this lol Maybe they put it on to root out the Karen's Only if it s served on the side so they can refuse to pay for it I just read that one too!! It s not the only inaccurate item avocado on a Greek omelette I mean, it probably tastes good, but avocados aren t Greek. maybe I m being too much of a Karen, lol. I was under the impression they liked eggs Benedict for some reason Rectified by the manager s manager Truth. Lol All rotten and smelling of cheap perfume On the side! That would bring in hella business lol This is one of the funniest comments I've seen in reddit in a long time, thank you kind stranger. My wife asked what was so funny and when I told her she said 'wouldn't most people get irritated by something like that?' I was like 'yes they would but the difference is that the majority would politely tell the waitress it needs to be fixed where as a Karen would flip shit and act like the waitress spat in her face' There isn't! Sally? Sauce made from egg yolks, butter, mustard, salt and pepper. It's delicious Not gonna lie idk, but that shit smacks Please pass me a napkin. Can we at least go with that s what she said? Same! The universe is trying to tell you something about hollandaise sauce. I had a sammich earlier this week that had hollandaise. I asked them to skip that part. Got it anyway. Scraped it off and ate. Then I read that post and I'm like, wow, very different reaction. But they had closed before they left! Nah you re just making a witty observation. But if instead you decided to turn off your human decency function, increase your entitlement to 1000%, and degrade someone over an avocado well then that d be different. Random ingredient missing each time they make one. Hollandaise randomly on the side or over the top. You forgot the lemon, but most of the time when I have hollandaise, it's not lemony enough, so I ask for lemon wedges. I might try it He* Hmmm and I happen to have a breakfast date tomorrow I shan t ignore the universe! We read the same post, lol. Thanks cats-n-caffeine for providing the link, though! It is 100% a nightmare of mine to be a Karen, so I do try to avoid it if I can. With occasionally switching the regular bacon with Canadian bacon I did! The lemon is crucial. ! gif giphy 31Q36EHJ7C5ZoIMw79 It doesn t matter who Yeah I figured we did haha. I should ve said I just read that post too",

		"body": "Was at a hobby shop today, they sell everything from fabrics to kitchen organizers to party supplies. My sister is currently at home on leave from her job and was bored so she made herself some bags from her old clothes, then she got really invested and convinced her bf that he needed one too both still at University, working part time for break, he humours her because she is REALLY bored. So we went to this shop to purchase some 'manly' fabric and a zipper for his new unwanted bag guy will take the case and love it no matter how lopsided it is stitched LMAO We wait in the line to be served and it becomes obvious fairly quickly that: A. The cashier is elderly so process is a bit slow. B. She had called for assistance and was waiting for a second cashier to turn up. We all heard her make the call. C. The shop is a bit short staffed at that moment No worries, she is flashing a giant smile at everyone, trying to be quick and apologizing for the wait. Now at this point my sister and I are number 7 and 8 in the line as I too had some purchases. There is an older married couple in front of us with 2 saucepans, a frying pan and some other items and several others with full carts due to their January sales. Behind us are another 4 people. Everyone is relaxed and waiting for second cashier while the old lady is doing her best to process people fast. The hubby of the married couple is twitching with impatience, titching his tongue and flailing his flabby fins about the wait. At one point he snorted and his bullish nostrils flared, I swear I saw snot glisten in those cavernous depths as we moved up the line. His wife is fairly melting as her neutral face slowly drips into an ugly frown and mouth drooped further to show her displeasure at not getting service right away. Then the cashier realised the system was down and let everyone know she will need to reboot. This is fine with everyone else except Mr. & Mrs Karen, he huffed his way to the security guard and pointed at the cashier, jabbing his elongated phalanges like they were laser points, at her head 'Are you aware there is only one cashier here?' 'Yes, unfortunately we are short staffed but a backup is on her way up.' Security is calm and DGAF. Big guy, muscled and looking like a beefy club doorman. 'This is how you treat customers? Look at the ungodly line!' Mr. Karen, resembling the shrivelled up elderly version of Slenderman, gestures in our general direction which beefcake ignores. My sister and I are number 5 and 6 now and a total of four minutes has passed since we joined the line. Mr Karen is getting some glares from those in front while the back of the line have not noticed yet. 'We are sorry for the wait, but the system is down and staff are stretched.' Beefcake says his final words and dismisses Slendermans grandpa with his nonchalant posture. Mr. Karen throws up his hands dramatically then scurries back to the mothership of all frowners where he proceeds to have a very animated and heat-filled conversation with Mrs. Karen about the audacity of staff, the lack of customer care and shit service in their native language which unfortunately the cashier and I both understood. Nonetheless at that moment, backup arrived and the line began to empty quicker as the second cashier began to put through customers. Now, I am not sure if the system failed again, it was karma, or if the cashier got her own back but as we were being served by the backup, the Karens had the original lady, who processed their transaction sweetly enough and asked them to put through their EFTPOS card. The system crashed mid-payment. With no confirmation, if their payment went through, they had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the system to reboot whilst Mrs. Karen frantically called their son to check if their online statement showed any payments they didn't have banking apps and were astonished such a thing existed when the much older cashier informed them of it with no confirmation they could not leave the store and Mrs Karen really wanted those 60% off pans. I lurked a bit by the entrance, pretending to pack our bags to watch the drama unfold as they huffed and puffed whilst both the cashiers had smiles that grew bigger and bigger with each passing moment. Sister had no idea she was likely dreaming up patterns for the case she would sew and had walked outside to wait for me. The line emptied and it's just these two now, still trying to put their card through and checking with their son who apparently blocked the card by accident thinking it was an unauthorized purchase I blame his mother, she worded it badly and anyone would misunderstand The system rebooted but the payment had not gone through so Mr. Karen fished out his credit card, acting like it was extremely painful to do so, to put through the purchase. The cashier printed the receipt and replied in their language to 'Have a nice day.' The startled look of embarrassment and frustration was worth the wait and both hurried out like they were running away. My sister and I had a good laugh when I told her and so did the cashiers, even beefcake had a tiny grin. Good lesson for them I reckon, pair of self-entitled idiots.",

TLDR: old couple hates waiting in lines, complains, karma gets hers. Some great descriptions. Should look at writing stories. The closing by the cashier was perfection r/Ispeakthelanguage would love this And F that Karen. Just wait your damn turn. I was at a hobby shop that the line at 6 registers was 8 people deep, over 30 minutes waiting because EVERYONE had big carts. My 4 skeins felt like a lot of effort, but I really wanted them... so I waited. I lurked a bit at the entrance lol, perfect! Sounds like a country where people don t have to queue up long lines all the time, or they are super impatient. A Hobby Shop has security? I'm assuming a Spotlight somewhere in Australia? I'm loving the details I love the way you write! Descriptions were hilarious. You are an amazing fun writer! This was such a fun read! What was the other language if you don't mind sharing? She stepped on that cord lmao TL;DR: fabric store security guard DGAF. What was this native language? *flailing his flabby fins* LOL Yeah pretty standard here to have security at all shops Close! I had this exact thought too! Thank you, I write what I see and I hate grammatical errors lol. Hindi They don't unless you try to shoplift then they will nail you to the ground!",

		"body": "The place I work at is a hole in the wall restaurant in a really small farming town. Think of Dog River from the show Corner Gas and it describes the vibe of the place. The outside is pretty run down since the upstairs tenants are car farmers so there is broken down cars all over the property. The food is really good and it has become the meeting place for a lot of locals mostly farmers and old timers. The interior of the place is really cute and it and has an old fashioned vibe to it. The food is amazing in my opinion and prices are pretty cheap. So we get a group of 3 middle aged women come in and they are instantly complaining about the outside of the place being messy and run down looking. I guess they are from a nearby city and saw that our restaurant has excellent reviews on Google and they wanted to try the place out. The server kindly told them that the restaurant has no control over what the outside of the place looks like made a 'Its a good thing you don't have to eat outside' joke and the women got offended and complained that we weren't taking their suggestion seriously. They all ordered eggs benedict and one of them asked for it to be made without hollandaise sauce. They also complained about service being slow but given that we where pretty slammed that day and we only have one cook we where doing our best. The lady that wanted no hollandaise sauce then came to the counter and rudely told us to add hollandaise sauce but she wanted it on the side because she wasn't sure if she liked it. We offered to let her sample some but she refused. Once their food was served she tired to send back the sauce but the server told her that we couldn't take if off the bill because we can't serve that sauce to someone else. She complained but the server stuck to her guns and told her next time try the sample when its offered if she isn't sure if she likes something. We will usually let people sample stuff so this exact scenario doesn't happen. It was close to closing so stopped serving new customers and we started doing our closing duties. We did not stop serving people who where already there however. The women all of a sudden got up and left without and we realized they hadn't paid yet. The server chased them outside and told them they forgot to pay. They told the server than since we closed while we where serving them they thought that they didn't have to pay. The server told them to pay and they told the server that since the hollandaise sauce wasn't taken off the bill they weren't paying. The server told them once again they had to pay for the food they ordered and since there was nothing wrong with the sauce it was not coming off the bill. The server threatened to call the police if they didn't pay and if they left she would record their licence plate and they would be banned from the restaurant as well. They reluctantly paid and of course didn't tip. I still don't understand how they thought they could have gotten away without paying. They kept saying 'You're closed we don't have to pay'.",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* You closed so we don't have to pay.....what?! That's not even almost logical. A group of Karens is called a 'complaint'. I would have auto-grat them for 15% There s a time and a place to put that on the bill. Hollandaise is the best part of eggs Benedict. Karen's are crazy. Karens live in their own world. That s why when the real world affects them they lose their ever loving minds. And if we close our eyes, you can t see us! Lalalalalala I can t hear you! eggs benedict without hollandaise? that's like asking for a PB & J, but hold the peanut butter and jelly ROFL Upvote, because Corner Gas. These people are learning that b!tching = free stuff, and it s a real problem. Part of this is confusing to me. Was there an additional charge for the hollandaise sauce because it was on the side? Why would the sauce that normally comes on eggs Benedict be a separate charge if it's put on the side? I love that idea! Imma try that at Macy's sometime. Just wander around until closing time, grab some coats and La Creuset and just leave. 'What? Everything's free after closing time!' This is why tipping is bullsh*t. Employees shouldn t be susceptible to Karens punishing them for dumb reasons. 1 Corner Gas reference = 1b this should have been an episode. 2 in what universe does we closed the place so the entire tab s on the house even exist?!? So many bars would go broke! 3 if she s old and gone her entire life without knowing what hollandaise sauce tastes like then she s a super picky eater and danger danger Will Robinson 4 And then to choose a nice little hole-in-the-wall place to finally try off-roading on your food safari is also a really strange choice. that s an actual Karen/Kevin post for once imo. Also assholes Who doesn't like hollandaise sauce? It's a good thing they didn't tip, they really showed that minimum wage employee who relies on those tips to survive who is boss. Don't they know the waiter cooks the food? 'Car farmers' LOL people are the absolute worst sometimes. thinking that they didn't have to pay for their food? where is that a thing? it isn't, and i'm glad that the server chased them down. i hope the restuarant keeps doing well and you don't have any more people like that showing up. in small towns like this i ask for the chef special - meaning give me the best of what he has and they are good at making or ask whats good today? Wait. You charge for hollandaise on eggs benedict? Is that not included? I really wanna go to this restaurant, 2 of my favorite places to eat are like that, very good food and down to earth staff, in rural farm towns that have a population under 2,500 From working with the public for 16+years, 5% of people are terrible people. I don't know if the know right from wrong or just don't care. If you have 20 tables one of them will be Karen's!!! should have let them to leave without paying then report them to the police. What is a car farmer? Must've been from Wullerton. deleted I bet they own MAGA hats What the hell is a car farmer? We're closed so spit the food out now To be clear they didn't really believe that 'You're closed we don't have to pay', they knew what they were doing and stuck to that story to not look guilty. A lotta people go to restaurants and think that for the time they re in there they are masters of the universe and the restaurant staff are their literal slaves. It s sickening but we also need more owners to stop treating customers like royalty and start protecting employees. I liked the part about how the staff didn t seriously take their complaints about the exterior condition of the property. Like you were supposed to go out and move all the abandoned cars. I'm convinced karens are people who delude themselves into thinking they are future millionaires so they treat retail/service workers like shit. Problem is, they don't have the money 'yet' so they have to resort to bum shit like this. Omg I am a server and I m so sorry you had to put up with that. I just got so frustrated reading your story. Especially the part where they thought they didn t have to pay because you guys were doing your closing work!! I would ve had a really hard time not being angry whilst telling them that they had to pay their bill and if not, we absolutely would be contacting the police and taking down their car color, make, model, and license plate number. Damn this post really raised my blood pressure Dang, the golden girls strike again. Sorry you had to deal with that. I want to try this place, is it in Saskatchewan? Im out there on the occasion Soooo my gf raised a valid point. If woke rules apply to all of us 'Karen' is a discriminatory term. Her name is Karin and to quote her 'not all karins are Karen's, why can't we call them cunts , cus that's what they are and leave the nice karins outta of it ' These Karens are absurd, but I'm confused about charging extra for hollandaise sauce. If it comes with the meal, why would you charge extra for it on the side? Sh*tty a** 'Karen's' aside this restaurant sounds like a neat place to eat at. If you don't mind OP where is it located? We're always looking for unique eateries to try out. Husband and I grew up in small farming towns so smaller places like your restaurant are some our favorite places to try Quite honestly I m tired of these capital C s Male or female and their thinking; I ll do as I please & you WILL comply It's standard an typical privledge... people like this literally complain about EVERYthing and should not be allowed to eat in public, or go to a store or gas station. You could spoon feed them an they would have issue with it. The spoon the hand the chair.. chronic cry babies. I absolutely abhor these kind of pissy acting people 'Of course they didn't tip' I really think that restaurants should share a list of patrons who pay on card and don't tip because the CC payment verifies all their info . Then you just have to switch the policy to be like hotels do - ask for the card before seating. Type the number in to the database search, and you know if you have a frequent or habitual no-tipper. And let them know that all prices are +20% to account for their belief that tips should be included in the default price. Guarantees the server a 15% tip, and the other 5% pays for whatever labor/etc are needed to maintain/update the list. Karens will use any excuse, won't they? Because they thought you were country bumpkins who would get confused by their city talk. This has probably worked elsewhere for them. They came in prepared to cause a problem. Got angry because they were able to manufacture a problem. Manufactured a reason to leave without paying and then got angry because they were told the reason was bullshit. Also, who the hell doesn't like hollandaise? I could eat that stuff like soup! LIKE. SOUP. Folie Trois. They knew they were stealing. They just thought they'd go for it. My parents once had some bogus coupon for The Melting Pot. After they ate, they presented this bullshit coupon. Server told them the coupon was bullshit. They claimed the restaurant had to honor their bullshit coupon. Manager said they would call the police if they didn't pay. They didn't pay. The police came and idk wtf was in their heads, you can't force a restaurant to take some bullshit coupon printed up by a scammer. I owned a breakfast/lunch place for five years and, other than the paying part, I would call OP's story a typical customer exchange on a typical day. they have a high opinion of their opinion. they don t get the place. from seeing the outside they decided they would help you out and tell you how it should be, or would be better. no. the don t pay / closing stuff is one of the weirdest things i have ever heard in my 28 years of restaurant work. good grief. Who doesnt want hollandaise sauce? Thats the good stuff D: Fuck all 3 of those Karens. They knew what they were doing, fuck em and ban them all! I keep thinking I ve read it or seen it all and then I read or see something that overtakes the previously bad thing Karen s have done They seriously thought they didn t have to pay??? What??? Fucking report them for shoplifting.. let them deal with that shit for 6 months ie brand them as thieves.. Three white ladies with short hair? Next they will each leave a one star review so brace yourselves The serving staff should put up a few bad reviews to keep the out of town riff-raff away. Should have let them leave ,get their plates and call local PD and get them arrested. Think that would have been a big fuck you Karen Oh no, once you leave and get caught, there should be a mandatory fat tip or they deal with the police. Unpopular opinion, but I think the restaurant industry is doomed. Customers are too demanding, restaurants are not willing to be as flexible as they used to be, and the wait staff usually takes the brunt of the abuse, so no one wants to serve anymore. deleted You may be from Holland where they do this for plurals, but Karen s is a possessive in English and shouldn t be used here. It s a bad trend downwards in English grammar and it s being used all over the internet. So THATS why so many people bang on the doors once they're locked for the night 5mins before posted closing time What kind of defence is that? You closed when we stayed after closing so we thought we didn t have to pay? People are fucking wild No embarrassment for those three. Lol. What a scene. Wtf that kinda shit makes me want to lose it. should have snapped a picture to put 'em up on a wall of shame What is wrong with people! Really! You re closed so we don t have to pay, what kind of logic is that! What a bunch of idiots!! The story feels like it was written by an AI Bot. asshats...same ol' Thing Swift and exacting violence always solves these types of situations There's a place like this in my mother's home town and I once had the pleasure of watching one of the employees refuse service to a group like this. It's a small building between an auto body shop and a brickyard. Two couples came in complaining about the gravel parking lot and the 'junkyard' next door. Then they complained about the table that they were shown to. At this point one of the servers walked over to them and told them to leave and not come back. It was awesome. I'm just hung up on the eggs benedict order. WTF orders it without hollandaise sauce? That's what makes the dish. Car farmers . Please explain to me what a car farmer is. That s some Mitch McConnell logic right there. Karens be Karens. I'd say they are simply seasoned grifters looking for little busy places easy to scam >They kept saying 'You're closed we don't have to pay'. The problem with people like this is that there is a chance they actually believe it makes sense, and it's like a glitch they got away with, but it could equally be that they know it makes no sense and are just hoping you can't prove they don't believe it and you will give up because of frustration. Democrats!!! Who is in charge of the outside of the restaurant? I'm confused. I work in a restaurant and the restaurant does painting, cleaning, flowers etc. Am I not understanding? I mean, we pay maintenance people and grounds people etc. Does the city own it? I know it's not the point of this lol. It's just nagging at me Do they also think leaving a few French fries on a plate means they don t have to pay for them? I m a city folk, this place sounds great. And didn t realize they didn t pay is bullshit Reminds me of a time in seventh grade when I loaned a classmate $5 and when I tried to get it back she told me she couldn t pay me because she was saving up for contacts. Basically, I m not going to pay because I don t feel like it. It d be great if the entryway had an asshole detector to keep them out. I ve found that a lot of people who think like this operate under the belief that if they say it then it s true, or if they want it/don t want it badly enough then they deserve it/deserve something immensely better and made of gold. I assume the entitlement comes from being a huge pain in the ass and not hearing the word no nearly enough. Shoulda taken a picture of them to name and shame. You need to post a sign and note it in the menu also: 'Difficult customers will be charged up to two times the menu price. Adjustments are at the discretion of your server. Have a nice day!' Understand that some people are just pieces of 2-legged shit. In your business, I m sure this isn t anything new to you - if it is, awesome! The explanation is simple. They are stupid and feel entitled. Woolerton. PFFFFT! They were completely ridiculous of course, but I m curious why the one woman would have to pay for a side of sauce that would have otherwise come on her eggs benedict if it was served as usual. It s a standard part of the dish. Please tell me without telling me these fine women were part of the after Sunday services breakfast crowd. I would have let them leave and called the cops with their plate number in hand People who got sauce hollandaise were always suspect to me They probably also just came from church too This is why all the Karens show up 5 minutes before closing time! They think they won t need to pay! Who would think that in the first places? Eggs Benny always has hollandaise.... I don't expect a discount when I tell a server to hold the onions or similar. What's wrong with people these days, I have years of retail experience. The retail version of this is someone saying 'I guess it's free' when something doesn't scan a few times. Had a karen, during Christmas, get mad when I punched in the sku on a game that wasn't scanning. Like... what? People really think this shit will work?? Curious - Did the restaurant contact Police and turn in license plate ? Sorry, happen to you I tried eggs Benedict once. I didn t like it. It was cooked fine. I paid. Now I don t order eggs Benedict restaurants hate this one secret trick! I think they where mad that we had the audacity to close the restaurant when they where there. Our business hours are 7am-2pm because we have 1 cook. It reminds me of when I worked retail and I d hear the same stupid dad joke 10x a day, There s no price tag, I guess it s free! THIS is why Karens always go to stores five minutes before closing . They are tipping their hands . Toddlers try the waiting game all the time. I m betting they spent too long camping at a different restaurant with the kind of crappy POS system that doesn t allow transactions after a certain time, and ended up having their meal comped bc it wasn t possible to ring out their check anymore. Then, they decided to try this everywhere they went from that moment on. If anything I would probably pay more/tip more if I was served past the closing time for keeping the staff there late Brb gonna go camp out at the grocery store until they close yeah I think they thought we should have stayed open as long was there Dash and dine. Simple. Karen logic Yeah that's a brand new one for me and i worked in foodservice for 20 years. A lot of people think that there are simple glitches in everyday life they can use to prevent having to pay for things. But it's also possible they knew it didn't make sense and were hoping that you can't prove they don't believe it, and will eventually give up out of frustration. Well fortunately in restaurant school they teach you if it's closed you don't have to cook for those bitches either. *'that's UnPossible !'* A *small group. A larger group is called a home owners association. I thought it was already established that a group of Karens is a 'hassle' A group of Karens is a flock of cunts. Legit this was the first thing I thought when they walked in. Correction: A group of karens is called a 'privilege' A group of Karen's is called a 'homeowners association' Definitely!!!! With how they acted, it was obvious that there weren t going to tip. What horrible, evil bitches. If that s how they act, I feel so bad for their families. Yup. It s no longer a gratuity. It s a fee for dealing with your bullshit. YEP!!!! Is that legal if the place doesn't say ahead of time? Non American here Australian Can you please explain what auto-grat is? I understand the tipping culture but don t understand this Um more like 25%. I am not understanding why the sauce was extra, though. Is it eggs Benedict without hollandaise? yep and everyone should cater to their every need. It doesn't matter that we only have 1 cook and she's been there since 5am and she's exhausted and needs to go home and rest. My mom and I have a running joke as both people who have a history in hospitality/retail. These people are NPCs who have 'main character syndrome'. Everything in their perspective/world is/should be catered directly for them and no one else Quick question, was the hollandaise still intact when they left; or did someone eat it? Not sure if you re also talking about Republicans here lol. The very definition of 'entitlement'. Officer! Why are you arresting me? You see this YouTube? This is police brutality! That is my purse! My property! He is taking my property! I want my purse now! I WANT MY PURSE NOW! Oh I'm gonna sue the living shit out of you, what's your name and badge number... *Meanwhile the name and badge number is visible on the uniform of most cops*. Oh he is not giving me his name and badge number, you have to give it to me when I ask for it. I pay taxes so I pay your salary! Officer why was I arrested? *Meanwhile still resisting arrest because of her disorderly conduct and her Karenism is showing* *Meanwhile other observing Karen's are also recording and 'You see this? Police brutality! What did she do to get arrested? Look they are arresting her for doing nothing.' *Internal stfu/fml mode for the cops activated* I'm pretty sure that without the sauce, it is an egg mcmuffin 'Yeah, hold it between your knees% They may like that, you know, seeing as they are more often than not not saying that POC can t be Karen s but they are plain white bread themselves. Might be just their wait for it BREAD AND BUTTER Our restaurant is like Corner Gas mixed with Letterkenny seeing as it is in rural Ontario. Our chef is a kindly old women that reminds me of Emma and the co-owner is like Lacy. I guess that makes me a genderbent Josh minus the hairnet. What would Karen and Davis do? I did a double take at the CG reference. I feel like no one knows Corner Gas and they really should. It s free on Prime! We deducted the cost from the order and then we added it back on after she asked for it on the side I had the same question. Yeah I'm not a fan of tipping as well, it makes it stressful for us to have to rely on the goodwill of others to earn a living. I'm making more now than what I did when I was running my own business cleaning people's houses so I'm content. I don t care for it so I never order eggs Benedict, problem solved. I don't. Hot mayo is gross. I'm a chef and I hate it lol I ve yet to try hollandaise because the mere concept of it makes me feel bloated and artery-clogged but I would never make that the restaurants problem like wtaf You say that like these people wouldn't enjoy doing that exact thing consciously. It a general term used for anyone that has a shit ton of broken down cars rotting away in a field and its surprisingly common in my area. My guess is that because they put it on the side, the woman who requested it decided it was an add-on like adding bacon to a cheeseburger and since she didn t use it, it should be taken off her bill. Completely illogical but that s typical of a whackadoodle. OP's response to this question https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckyoukaren/comments/109yjje/_/j42op4a?context=1000 Right? That part makes no sense Looks like when she changed her mind about not wanting it at all to on the side it got rang in as a side. She shouldn't have been charged extra for that. Anything beyond what is factored into the good cost should be. Anyone who has a shit ton of broken down cars rotting away in a field. Extra points if they constantly talk about how they are going to restore them some day and make a ton of money. Someone who keeps/buys junk cars? I think *spits over shoulder * *spits* Its just a poached egg on an English muffin without it which seems disgusting OP said they were in Canada. Any person who has a shit ton of broken down cars rotting away in a field, I guess this is a rural Canadian slang term My guess is that they collect scrapped and junk cars and sell the parts. Someone who buys/keeps a bunch of junk cars? I think.. lol At first I thought it might be a typo. Nope. As much as there are people who would use this lie, there are also people who are legitimately that dumb. Or who think that they might get away with it because they may have discovered a secret legal loophole. To be fair, waiters derive from servants and are fairly unnecessary. I would rather be able to eat decent food for less money and have to walk to the counter myself. yeah there is junked out cars and a few out building piled with trash around the property that we can't do jack shit about. A lot of people complain about it but we literally can't fix it. There is no other places in town that the owners can rent. No its in Ontario Southern Ontario Canada PM me for more details don't tell them about how you discovered the place lol Hierarchy is a pretty common mentality. People already accept it in tons of other areas of life, these people are just bold enough to try to break the rules in their favor. What city talk? A lot of people think they are going to discover a loophole where stealing becomes legal. But that only really works if you have a lot of money. Did they know the coupon was bullshit, or are you saying it was just something too good to be true. I told my boss we should add a 'Asshole tax' where if you are a dick you pay a 15 percent surcharge on the bill if you are a dick. The servers usually joke with customers when they start being difficult that prices have gone up because they are being difficult. Enough people hate cooking enough to want to eat out. We have a lot of regulars that come in 7 days a week because the can't/won't cook for themselves. The restaurant tries to be flexible within reason. There isn't many options in my small town so people have to stay humble because they don't want to get banned from one of the 3 places to eat in town. We don't charge extra but whenever someone asks for something removed from the meal we try to subtract the cost of the item from the bill. We gave her a discount for no sauce and then removed it after she asked for it on the side It sounds like a legal chop shop It was a weekday so I doubt it 'my grandma uses it every day, and sells out, now they can't get enough' A hidden loophole that could save you THOUSANDS!!! They weren t mad. They were pretending to be mad because they needed an excuse not to pay Your business hours are 7am-2pm because you specialize in breakfast and lunch. Also, the restaurant covers everything with one shift of full timers. Even if you had five cooks, it's unlikely the business hours would change Please learn the difference between 'where' and 'were'. removed I worked in a restaurant with a co-worker server named Charity. She told me that every time she introduced herself to a new table, some idiot would comment 'Oh Charity!! So our meal is free today!' The comeback is if there is no price tag I guess it is not for sale I work in retail and my company has so many things that don't scan and they never fix it. It's only the 50+ that still say this. And then I ask them if that has ever worked. And also go fuck your self. Ok I don't say the last part but it would feel so gooooooood I work in retail as well and I get that if it doesn t want to scan A lot of people don't entirely grasp what exactly money is, and so they expect random things to be given to them for free. Like people with artists. Even if they don't try to get away without paying at other times, a lot of people get confused that artists expect actual money because they interpret it as a hobby.And in their mind it is greedy to try to be paid for a hobby. What the hell kind of system is that? There is something called an end of day process, where the checks gets closed and the employees on the clock get checked out and clocked out. However, that end of day time is normally in the middle of the night, not an hour after the doors are shut in the afternoon. An even larger group is called a city council. Depends on what literature you read. Now, now. No need to insult cunts! For sure! So usually in very small print at the bottom of the menu it will say for parties of 6+ an auto gratuity automatic tip of 15% will be added to the bill . So the server has the option to assign the tip at their discretion. With the kicker being some people tip well over 15% for good service Never seen Auto over 18% We deducted the cost from her sauce from the bill when she asked for it without the sauce and then added it back on when she asked for it on the side. I'm not getting that either, it's not like they wanted extra sauce. They asked for _their_ sauce to be on the side. If I asked for a cheeseburger but lettuce/tomato/pickles on the side, I wouldn't expect to get charged for that - it's the same amount, just next to the burger instead of on. Yeah, same question, u/motherofredfox If Hollandaise is included with the dish, why is it extra to get it on the side, instead of on the eggs? I didn't even think about this lol smh I believe it was because she ordered it without the sauce. So the food was made to order. Then she came up, before it was brought out, demanding she now wants it on the side because she doesn't know if she likes it or not. They specifically tried to get her to taste a little before wasting an entire side and she refused. If she had just ordered it on the side to begin with, they likely wouldn't have charged her for it. IMO opinion of course lol Maybe they knew it wasn't gonna be tipping so they got their tip one way or the other? Not to me! >we only have 1 cook and she's been there since 5am and she's exhausted *'How is that our fault? We're paying customers!....oh wait, we tried not to be...'* Your little restaurant sounds adorable! I love little unique places that are so treasured by their community. Yeah but what you need to remember is that these poor long-suffering Karens might have had a bad experience somewhere else already - maybe they had to wait an extra 15 mins at the salon because the manicure station was a bit behind in its appointments. Then they were *further* inconvenienced because the common plebeians of you and your staff didn't crawl over on hands and knees, offering the hollandaise up to them like tribute to a goddess. How dare you OP. HOW. DARE. YOU. /s Sorry, but crab-asses like those set my sarcastic rant button on overdrive lol I wish you and your staff a better day for tomorrow! It was intact but health and safety states that once food touches a customer's table it can't be served to anyone else. Definitely applies. It s such a great show! Endlessly rewatchable and the writing is so smart. Ah. You should add that to the post I will legit pay extra - *more* than I would with a 15% tip - to avoid tipping and have the menu tell me how much my food will actually cost. Tipping is the absolute worst. 'It's an EMULSION not mayo,' My boss tries that. I'm like, it's hot mayo. I've never heard anyone else use that lol I personally love it, but I have a dairy allergy and one of the ingredients is butter so I haven't had it in YEARS. I also like mayo in general and I realize that's not everyone's thing. Quite familiar with the actual act of having a shitload of cars broken down in a field aptly describes my grandparent's rural farm , but hadn't ever heard the term 'car farmer' before. There s a place up the road from me that has a ton of boats think 50 or more in their yard and we call it the boat farm. I think they are supposed to be some sort of storage or repair shop but it s the same exact boats that have been there for years so I m not sure what exactly is happening at the boat farm. First 9f all on the side is an extra dish to wash. 2nd a small container er of sauce is more than the bit that os typically piston top. So, more product I see, thank you. My s.o.'s father is like that, but I've never heard the term before. Irrelevant Thank you for explaining. I was so confused! Sad, when I heard small town restaurant with old cars everywhere I was super excited. You can DM so I will put it on my list for my cross Canada road trip this summer It was printed in something that was distributed to them in some manner. The distributor didn't clear the coupon with the actual restaurant so it was super shady business but they didn't know that other than whatever red flags this thing had to be throwing off to just be making up coupons out of thin air. Sorry, I know it's a stupid and confusing story. I completely agree with you. I grew up in a relatively small town too and there were only a handful of restaurants beside a few chains closer to the freeway. I like to go out to eat because I like the atmosphere and it s nice to get out of the house, I m actually a decent cook too. Where I live it wouldn't be legal to have a setup like that. You can't even have a car on your property that isn't completely registered and tagged etc etc or the police will find it on your property and give you lots of fines. That reply was more towards all the self-righteous people who go to church act like they can treat others any way they want. Exactly based on the fact that they were complaining as they walked in, it seems like they were fishing for a comp. These are the types of customers that make me hate working in the service industry. I work long, grueling hours, doing something that I am passionate about, and doing it all through the physical pain of being a veteran and lifelong physical laborer, and a subset of the population thinks that my work should be handed to them because they don t like a sauce on a dish that they ordered. I m man enough to admit when I fuck up, and sometimes they are in the right, if I overcook a dish, of miss a modification, but 99 times out of 100 they are just looking for something for free. You say this, but people will get legitimately angry if they are trying to scam you and feel like it's not fair that you caught them before they could. Please learn the difference between useful criticism and nitpicking to make yourself feel superior. This comment was like the other Karen's hollandaise - unwanted. removed removed She gotta come back with, I m actually going to charge you double, and donate the second plate of food to charity. When they say No, hit em with, well I guess that s why your name isn t charity. Alright, at some point you just have to take the L and use your middle name. Kudos to her parents for choosing a name so easy to make fun of I'm like '5 dollar surcharge for making that joke' and we both lol and move on. I'm over 50 no one ever gets it right, though--one day soon, probably! , and I'd no more say that stupid shit than run a 4-minute mile. When there's a problem, I immediately ask if the easiest thing to do is either back out or cancel my transaction. I can usually find a duplicate item much more quickly than someone else, and I'm not going to have kittens if they help a few people while I'm gone, though I do ask politely if it would be okay if I didn't go to the very back of the line again. I've worked retail. I've heard every lame-ass joke, every insult, every complaint, and every shitty name from mild insults to real doozies so long and so foul I sort of wish I didn't get pissed, because they really should be recorded for later use. There is no way on this planet I'm going to do a damned thing to further complicate the day of the person across the counter from me. He or she has already dealt with so much crap I'm often amazed, depending on which store I'm in, that the uniform for checkers doesn't include hip waders. Some of us do have your back--I'm truly sorry we're a minority. >only the 50+ that still say this I think it's only old white people that say it. I'm white and 50+, and I don't say it to store employees.... anymore. It s a POS POS system lmao Thank you, these people lack the warmth and depth. Cows. A group of cows. That's pretty nice yall take off the cost of unwanted toppings, most places just leave the price as is even if I say not to include the bread or side salad for example. You shouldn't have deducted the cost of sauce from a dish. It's more work than it's worth, and fresh made-to-order hollandaise is already going above and beyond. They were always going to be crap customers though, so it's not on you. But you shouldn't bother to take the cost of the sauce off for anyone but an especially nice regular. I would definitely not want to pay an extra charge for having something that is part of the dish and therefore included in the price be put on the side. I order a salad, but I don't want it drowned in 4 gallons of dressing as if it's a soup, so I ask for the dressing on the side. Never been charged for additional dressing... I think it was included, but Karen wanted a discount because she didn't use hers or didn't like it. I have no idea OP stated elsewhere the cost of the sauce was deducted when she asked for no sauce initially honestly they shouldn t have bothered with that and they added the charge back in when she changed her mind and asked for the sauce on the side. Ikr?! Honestly I was And I guess I still am a regular at the restaurant before I got hired as a dishwasher. They are super nice people and I love the regular clientele. All the tables are from thrift stores and most are antique/vintage. All the mugs and tea pots are mismatched and cute. Most of the customers are amazing a polite which is why I started working there So subtle and quirky and specific. It s my comfort show and you re so right, endlessly rewatchable. Thanks Karen I m not gonna knock it till I try it, I am a mayo enjoyer myself if I remember to reply here when I try it I ll let you know what I think hehehehe Ah bet yer one ah them thar city slickers that thinks them cars come from factories! Them grow on farms o'course! I totally agree. I also have a rule, be nice to anyone who brings you food or medicine because you don't know what they can do to it while in the backroom. This! Also, while I hate the current system where businesses can basically say hey, we don t feel like paying a living wage, so you do it on top of the bill for everything else but seeing as it s the system we live in you need to stay home if you can t or don t want to tip. And more servers should probably be aware that if the tips and base pay together don t add up to minimum wage it s supposed to be the business duty to make up the difference in lots of states here in the US. Edited for typos removed Reminds me of the time we went into Hooters in Panama City Beach and there was a heavily-pregnant Hooter called Randy. Being an English gentleman, I didn't pass comment. I had neighbors growing up with three daughters: Chastity, Purity, and Prudence. Oof. But that's why Charity became such a greedy miser I don't know if this is good or bad, but I spent too much time in retail and food service, and it is that age range but usually the better off folks of any ethnicity that pul this. It is like they feel they are owed something for being well-off and not having died yet. I snort laughed at this . Hey! I grew up with dairy cows! Cows are not Karens! Cows are sweet. It's the bull that'll try and kill you. I make it a point of never complaining when someone gives me food You found your way out of the Backrooms!? Huzzah! removed No doubt! But you ever wanna see a Karen apoplectic, call her a stupid cow to her face. Right? The audacity of some folks, complaining when there are starving people in America Annie Kinsella--- 'At least he's not a book burner, you Nazi cow!' I love that scene in Field of Dreams! I don't think the world used to be like this say 30 years ago. Everybody's attitude changed in regards to it's all me me f*** everybody else. Why don't people care about others anymore. It's sort of the same thing with COVID in regards to people refusing to wear a mask and making fun of others who are. Because if it doesn't affect them, it doesn't mean s***",

My normal work clothes, I get into the women's locker room and Karen does a double take when she sees me. I will admit I don't look very girly. I look just like my father and with the hat I look even more like him. I don't mind. I'm used to it. I go to unpack my bag and start getting undressed and she tells me that I'm in the wrong locker room. That the men are down the hall. I tell her very slowly that I am in the right room. That if she doesn't believe me she can look at my driver's license. She starts yelling at me and leaves the room. I sigh and know she's going to the front desk. I quickly get dressed and lock my stuff up knowing that the ladies at the desk know who she's talking about. I walk towards the desk and call one of the ladies by name and say hi. She smiles brightly and says 'Hi, my name ! Have a good workout!' Karen was ten shades of red. Update: today I had my boxing class and when I was done before I left I ran into the manager of the gym. She asked if I was okay after what happened and I told her I was good. Told her I dealt with worse at work. She told me she had a long talk with the woman and revoked her membership and donated the rest of her fees to our local gay community center. Karma came back and got the Karen. I also dropped 5 pounds! I just want to say thank you to everyone for the messages and the support. You guys are awesome. Thank you all!",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* A friend from high school got all of her genetics from her very German dad. She had the height and build that could throw hay bales and not even blink. Unfortunately that meant high school was rough for her because teenagers are stupid and mean. Lordy, Karen's really out here forgetting that masculine women have been a thing for centuries. Idk if you even look all that fem in your facial features but the voice didn't tip her off? One of my embarrassing moments of my life .. This was at least 20 years ago but I'll never forget. I was walking out of a public restroom at a park. This person was walking in. I looked at them and blurted out, oh, this is the women's restroom. She says 'I know'. She really did look very masculine but she was definitely a she. I am so humiliated that I did that. Why that came out of my mouth I'll never know. But I will never forget. And this is why transphobia isn't just a trans issue. It also affects cis people who don't match the expectations of bigots IE tomboyish women, butch lesbians, curvier men, short men, etc. Oh man wait until she hears about lesbians since she's so concerned about a potential male leering at her in the change room this is why i m nervous to keep going to the gym as i progress in my transition. i just started testosterone i m FTM but i still use the women s locker room and restroom as i don t pass very well and i have loads of anxiety. but i know im going to look too masculine to be in the women s soon. i don t care what one i use but everyone else does apparently :/ Maga Karens on the loose. You have bearded dragons, work at a men's prison and deal with Karens, damn you need a medal Ignore the Karen and let's get to the real question : Was your workout as relaxing as you needed it to be? I used to go to a local gym that was never busy and it was pretty small. One day, I was changing in the locker room and a really pretty woman came in too. As I was headed out she was changing but I glanced over not sure why but she had a penis. Honestly I wasn t bothered at all because it not like her intention was to creep on women in the locker room but rather she identified as a woman. I know lots of people who d be uncomfortable with that but like I said there was no creepy intent. Also the gym was basically empty all the time so not many people were there. It s always surprising to me that people pay attention at all to who is in the bathroom/locker room. A purple alien could be one urinal over and I probably wouldn t notice or care. I work in the system too and one of my coworkers always walks out of in service training if it deals with LBTGQ+ issues. She hasn t promoted in 10 years but feels the organization is against her. I ve seen her act arrogant around cis folks who don t fit into the old gender types. Karma is going to get her though. She may not want change but management will. I hate that these people are embarrassed by being mistaken, but not by being jerks. Hey, could be worse. You could meet her at work! Did the gym revoke the woman's membership for aggressive sexual harassment? Don't let it bother ya too much. Just laugh at the ignorance lol. She s mad she could never beat you up Fuck her and her bullshit attitude. I get attacked all the time for looking trans even though i'm cis. it's insanely stressful and unsafe at times. i developed a keen sense of empathy for trans people because of it though. i personally wish masc-looking cis women like me would qualify for assistance for gender-affirming surgeries, but that's because i have body dysmorphia and/or dysphoria and am not ok with my body. you seem 100% comfortable with your excellent self and i tip my proverbial hat to you. screw that karen either way Urghhh. Like yes I ll do a double take if someone masc looking is in the change room. Mostly because I ll want to check I ve entered the room I meant to. And then. Shock horror. I ll just mind my own business and get changed. I don t understand why this is so difficult. Are we related because the same shit happens to me. 6 . Big feet. Look like dad As a masculine / gender nonconforming woman, I can relate. Have met many restroom Karens and actually ended up cancelling my membership at a women-only gym because even there, I was harassed in the bathroom. How dare a woman look not extremely feminine! As a trans guy that is literally my worst fear. Since I haven't transitioned yet, I have to use the women's restroom and its fucking akward because I look and dress like a guy. my ex girlfriend got sick and she had to go to the toilet of the gas pump, i waited for her outside but when it took too long i walked in and saw that she was struggling to wash her face to recover, i helped her at that moment 2 karens walked in and clearly showed that I didn't belong there while they realized very well that something was going on, a little later a sweet old woman came in and saw us like that, at first she was shocked which I understood but immediately started looking for tissues in her bag for my girlfriend and said this morning nausea also bothered me a lot but my husband never helped me. she thought my girlfriend was pregnant : sweet. of course the first 2 females heard it too and yet when they were done I got a comment. this is not the way you are here. stupid karen! I've had this a few times. The questioner is is usually very embarrassed when they realise their mistake. My only complaint is that you offered for her to see your driver's license. Fuck that. She doesn't deserve the offer. Okay, Transgender woman here. This is the second story I heard like this recently. The other one being a person in the UK who had a double mastectomy from Breast cancer so she had a flat chest and short hair chemo and she was also harassed by a Karen for the same reason. It s sick It seems Karens hate us, I think, because we upset their natural hierarchy To say the least I ve heard of none of my fellow trans persons attacking people in washrooms, it s all Cisgender Karens usually attacking another cis woman she feels is probably trans when most of these people prob wouldn t even clock me as trans B/C their spotting guide is really flawed, duh Moral of the story is, transphobia effects and hurts us all and My existence shouldn t be as contentious topic as it is right now Somebody watches too much Fox News. Even the thought of trans people... wow dem blue lines As former security, I can relate. Lol Ugh pure Bliss to prove someone wrong then watch them get all upset Uniform, boots, hat and about to work out. Damn what s wrong with you Karen!? Lol You handled it very nicely. The infuriating nerve! If it had been done to her, you know she would have been screaming for retribution to all employees and demanding stuff to make up for this harassment. What was the front desk gonna do, transform you into a man so they could throw you out? Ex prison officer here UK . Is there any reason why you wear your clothes outside of work? Could you keep them at work and change there? There s been instances where prison staff have been targeted in public because they ve had their uniform on. I always changed mine before going anywhere or I went directly home. Just looking out for your safety, not trying to be judgmental hope it hasn t come across that way . Keep up the good work, some days can be tough. As a side note, and total shitpost for fun and if i ever had this problem not likely as a big barrel shoulder man, with a toolshed, and a goatee I would just drop trow and show the flowers.. and say something like..' Can you see it now???' lol Psycho MAGA bigot. Did everyone cheer? Karen should ve been kicked out & banned for a month for being judgmental. Damn cunt. On the opposite note, my very petite male cousin finally cut his hair short after a store clerk said 'May I help you madam'. I remember him telling me a story about when he was in a bathroom stall and these three male kids came in and unlocked the stall door looked in, looked at each other, then left. At the time it was quite puzzling. Looking back I'm certain it was because they thought he was a girl using the men's room. I m sorry. Even though this is a Karen story I couldn t help but feel bad for you. Ignore ignorant Karen s. They re just miserable people who do nothing but spread their misery! DHOTY This is awesome Yup. The same thing happened to me. I was bullied a lot and my very German/swedish dad put me in boxing lessons after I was beat up in a locker room. That shit never happened again. There are some days where the comments or side eyes don't bother me but this last few weeks at work shit has been stressful and that sadly has bleed over into my non work life. This got me thinking. How much does a hay bale weigh? What type of physique does it require? Can I throw a hay bale? How far does the hay bale need to go to consider it a throw? I guess not. I even used my 'inmate is yelling ' voice. Which is softer than I would normally use. Women can have low voices too. I have been karen'd in women's bathrooms for this. There's a reason why wonder woman and the Amazon's are a thing Karens aren't interested in science, logic or even observation. They just pick a random thought and run with it No adams apple didn t clue her in? Oh my goodness. I had a guy ask me if my name was given to me to make me tough. Like a boy named Sue, like the Jonny Cash song and I rolled my eyes at him and said 'No, like a girl name my name .' My very female name. If only Karens could feel shame. I m a woman who is frequently called sir. We butch gals know when someone is being a Karen or an honest mistake. You sound like a very kind person. I hope you can let your mistake go. I think you were probably just trying to be helpful wouldn t beat yourself up. I was at the gym in the pool. I normally go to this gym's different location. When you go into the locker room from the pool they have white milk colored opaque glass with a silver 'Mens' or 'Womens'. Well I was not wearing my glasses -6 , and misread the sign. So I walk in and there is the long mirror with a bunch of sinks, but no one at them. Then I hear a voice. YIKES dash back out. Luckily no one saw me. Now I take my glasses into the pool and put them on my towel.... Years ago, when I was stationed in Charleston, South Carolina, we had a very androgynous looking student. Well, my chief decided to bring the student into an office and educate them on the appropriate grooming standards for haircuts. When he asked them for an explanation, the student simply said what about my hair goes against the grooming standards for females . The chief immediately apologized, and ran for cover amongst us, and then, when he finally got color back in his face yes, he actually turned white in his embarrassment , he started asking us questions, and flat out stated I didn t know Shortly afterwards, an email was sent out, quietly stating that the student in question was, in fact, in full compliance of grooming standards, and that further mistakes like this were not to be repeated, and if there was any confusion, ask for their advisor first. And yes, it took that chief years to live that one down Exactly! I have a faux hair cut and my work clothes are not for style they're for protection. My vest doesn't allow any figure to be shown. My protection is the price I pay for her being an idiot. And us bearded women. We still exist, you know. What an excellent point. Thanks I mean, I am a lesbian and I so wasn't leering at her! I was stuck in my damn stab proof vest. Right? Except my daughter, a lesbian, laughs at how so many assume she would even want to look at them lol I hope your transition is going smoothly! I wonder to help with your anxiety if your gym has a handicap bathroom you can change in. But, I would honestly say they can all fuck off. You do what's best for you! Just so you know, and aren t surprised when you move to the men s locker room: there will occasionally be old guys hanging out buck naked, wet from the shower, chatting with anyone nearby. I don t know why it s a thing, but it is. I don t know what the women s locker room is like, cis male here , but privacy and social norms around nudity seem to be ignored by old guys in locker rooms . Maybe they just DGAF any more? I m no prude, but , dayum, it s weird to have a wet wrinkly naked stranger randomly chat you up. Its not COMMON, but if it happens, it s not you, it s them, so just carry on with your day. Who let the karens loose? Who who Right? I can handle idiots, I do it every day. I just want to workout and enjoy the release of my daily frustration. Somebody always finds a way to mix politics into everything. How did you get to MAGA from this post?? removed No medal. Just some basic respect. I had more respect today with my inmates than a normal person and the gym. Yes it was! Thank you! Listened to some good music and relaxed. Came home and got some kisses from my puppy, Benny. Exactly! I just want to get in and get out. I don't want to make eye contact with you. Hell yeah! I always feel sorry for people like that, your age is not an excuse. My parents are older and very supportive. So your age has nothing to do with it Right? I didn't stay around to hear what the receptionist said to her. Maybe I'll find out tomorrow. True! Good lord I'm so happy I don't work at a women's Prison. Lol I'm not sure what happened with her. I did my workout and got myself and left. The ladies at the desk were very busy when I was leaving. I wonder if I'll find out tomorrow when I go to my boxing class. Thank you. Today was just a lot and I needed to vent. I'm trying. I'm gonna take a shower and snuggle my puppy It really is. I hate being in public, it sets my anxiety off, I feel like I have to constantly watch my back, because of working in the prison, so it makes it really uncomfortable being around people I don't know. So I'm a get my shit and go type of person. The only place I'm not like that is at the gym. I think having the mirrors everywhere helps. But i can relax and let go of my stress. I'm sorry you feel that way. Has anything helped with that? not being comfortable with your body has to be fucking hell. I can't imagine that at all. You're amazing, deep down I hope you feel that. I'm not six foot, lol. Big hands, shoulders, no hips, and big feet. We might be cousins! Oh man. That fucking sucks. Like why are they making eye contact in a public bathroom. That's the last thing I want Oh my goodness I can't imagine. I wish you amazing luck when you do get to transition! You'll be amazing! Yeah, I was just trying to diffuse the situation, mostly so she would leave me alone. Next time I'll just show them my badge. it s the definition of being a Karen. I talked to one of my friends about it and she just started laughing. She teases me all the time that I use my 'C/O' voice when people annoy me. I guess dealing with major dickheads all day has its perks. Exactly. I wonder what the manager told her. Who fucking knows. I've been going to this gym for years and these ladies check me in before I'm even out of the car. I knew they had my back from the second the crazy left the room. I appreciate that! Most days I take the vest and the parts of my uniform that have my badge and name on it off in the parking lot. But I feel safe at the gym so I go there straight after work. I wish our facility had something newer like that, it's the second oldest in the state and where our work locker rooms are is a disaster and is in a closed building. Maybe something to bring up at the next union meeting. Don't worry it doesn't sound judgmental at all! Thank you, the holidays are always rough and everything is starting to settle back down. Oh my goodness I wish I could. I'm way too shy for that, lol. Thank you for making me laugh. I have male friends that have that same issue. We met at the gym, he's in one of my workout classes, and he tells me that he wishes we had a unisex locker room that we can use instead. It makes me sad that he changes in the family bathroom instead. Thank you friend. I feel sorry for her. That she has spread her misery to others just because I don't look like her ideal version of a woman. She can fuck off. I m sorry people are still so stupid and cruel. Please know that they are just ignorant pricks who are looking for a target and will get it all back at some point. Beauty isn t in any certain size, skin tone or build. I jokingly refer to my daughter as a child of the Earth. She's stocky, has no jumping abilities, and watching her run is comical. I keep this all inside, and got her in my weightlifting coach's rec class thinking she could use a little body awareness / control. She, at 8, has fallen in love with Olympic weightlifting. It fits. Once she has that under her belt where she's receiving less help/guidance on average , she'll probably get tossed into BJJ or something similar. Pardon the rude terminology, but I really do love/prefer an amazon bush bitch...LOL Someone that can enjoy daily life as equals, and not so much the' Can you do this for me, I'm, just a little girl... etc crap.' Yah, I'm a merry mix of some of the east European tallest peoples. We mostly got our dad's half German looks. To be honest it's mostly been good because idgaf about men. Like they have to have a weapon. I know I can't take most of them but I can hurt them. Now that I'm old, I'm realizing perhaps I should not be picking up the couch to ge5 the cat toys. Because I slipped and broke my arm and it sucks. I can t answer most of that but she looked like a beginner body builder and caught hell for it. We all just encouraged her where we could. A two string square bale is about 60# and a 3 string is about 120. Round bales are like 1,000#. Someone would pick it up off the ground after it was baled and toss it in the end of a trailer where another person would stack it neatly. Back at the barn kinda the same thing to restack in the barn. Near the end you may have to toss some to someone else maybe 10' up. But mostly, you try to avoid throwing them violently because you don't want the bale to break. I just read this comment and I'm envisioning you talking to this Karen in the same tone Gale King talked to R. Kelly when she said: 'Robert...' Yeah I have a very deep voice, but then again I also have a fairly big chest and huge hips so that helps with morons. : Like bea Arthur from golden girls Just a respectful FYI, cisgendered women CAN have adam's apples, and cisgendered men can not! Even biological sex characteristics are fluid Where I'm from in KY, names like Shirley, Marion, and Kim are often men's names. My name is commonly a girl's name, but mine is spelled differently than the feminine version. BTW, I'm male. I took a lot of heat as a kid because of my name, but I am proud of it and wouldn't change it for anything, as I'm at least the 4th generation in my family to have that 'girl's name' as my name. I was an officer in a maximum-security men's facility back in the '80s. Rough job mentally and physically. My name is Susan, and I went by Susie as a child. I was teased mercilessly when A Boy Named Sue came out. Children are cruel They sure as hell can feel punches and kicks. I have thick, beautiful hair. I like to wear it in silly ways, color it how I please, and I like that it can reflect my mood. It's the one part of my body I like, so I try to rock it. However, since I am a cis white male, married, in his late forties, I catch a lot of heat for my style choices. Turns out I am decidedly unloved and unwelcomed in the hee-haw parts of Florida, and that's okay by me. I ve always been a tomboy, and more comfortable in jeans or shorts, though I can get dressed up for special occasions or fancy dates with a guy. For a while my hair was long and I would put it in a pony tail and throw on a ball cap. I try to always wear lipstick but I still got called sir more than a few times. I m just too old and have no shits to give about it. It s an honest mistake. Now if a Karen got in my face, I d love to set her straight. I ll never understand people who get upset over something that in no way affects them. Absolutely! I can't imagine the amount of BS y'all have to put up with on a near daily basis. Especially in today's sociological climate. PCOS. It s a bitch. Rofl yah I get that. We have guys at work that are homophobic and I'm like... Dude... You've been getting naked in front of buddy for years , you know he's gay right? What's your problem any other time? Lol Kudos to you, I have a time with an empty tacvest let alone something with weight and probably 10 velcro straps lol Edit: also I wasn't implying you were leering at her, but people like that forget that they aren't the center of the world so to her you definitely were lol Yeah people get pretty full of themselves, it's kinda funny. Like in change rooms and such. Like buddy, nobody cares what you look like and even if they did, you should be honored they find you interesting so long as it isn't weird obviously lol thank you! my gym is a planet fitness so sadly no private restrooms. it s super close to home for me though so worse comes worse i can just come in my gym clothes. i agree tho, everyone can fuck off. it s a locker room, why you looking?? > I don t know what the women s locker room is like, cis male here It s not like that, in my experience. You might see women who know each other chatting while they change, but just hanging out naked and chatting to random strangers is not a thing. I think it would be perceived as weird if not sexually aggressive. It's not that they DGAF any more, they've been doing that since they were kids, because that used to be normal. Starting with school gym class, you'd strip naked and shower, in open showers https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6f3cebd4f2f657c1025bf43f73301f4f-lq , walk back to your locker, and have a chat while getting dressed. Anyone who didn't strip would generally be mocked for hiding something or being scared. It's a habit they've had their whole lives, they're not going to change. Who let the Karen s out who who who who I believe the proven correlation of racism, homophobia, sexism, etc that comes from those in the maga movement was attached to the bias of the Karen. But I'm hypothesizing as the commenter would have to clarify. Because the Venn diagram of MAGATs and people who are scared of trans people is a circle. TBF, that just means you're a great CO. Exactly. Husband is 68, I m 63. We both take people as we find them. Life is too short to waste it on hating people. Good for you. Incidentally, if >snuggle my puppy is not a euphemism, it should be! Have a great evening. Bye cuz Thank you! You made me smile and snort. Thanks! That s good. Just keep your wits about you and be careful. The more inconspicuous you can be the better. Being a prison officer Is a thankless task. It s the forgotten service as you re never really in the public eye. You re doing a great job in a difficult role. Just remember that and be proud of the difference you make to society and those in prison who genuinely need your help. Laughs are good for the soul. or at least the mind hehe. I am fairly shy too, but when I get miffed, or put on the spot, the belligerence comes out, and it ends up fair game hahahah. It is sad. Maybe one day she will open her eyes and heart and be a happier person! Thank you, friend. I'm very proud of how far I've come since high school. I just hate that we still have to deal with such ignorant people. Venting a little helps and snuggling with my doggie also helps. Awesome! I've been boxing since I was a teenager and did BJJ in college and love them both. She's gonna be a little badass! I can't jump either. Oh my goodness. My father would never let us play dansel's in distress. He has four sisters, three daughters, three granddaughters, and has been married to my mom for almost 43 years. He's grown up with tough girls and my parents wanted us the same way. The only sort of maintenance stuff I can't do is fix cars, but everything in the house I can do because he's made sure that I wouldn't need someone to do something for me. My sisters are the same way. I wanna be like Wonder Woman. My daughter always referred to them as oh poor lickle me - she had the pouty lip off to a tee. I think the actual term is Weaponised Incompetence? But oh poor lickle me used to crack me up. Oh no! I hope you get better soon. My dog does the same thing. When I box and spar I make sure I do so with men since they're my major threat at work. But I've seen more ladies break fights up at work then the men. I have done that. There's no point in yelling at people when they're upset. I do the same thing with my nieces and nephews when they get all worked up. I never realized all the training skills they gave us work and in normal life too. THEY TRYNA KILL ME another respectful FYI, it's cisgender, without the -ed My limited knowledge showed. Thank you for helping me be more inclusive. I am serious, and don't call me Shirley. For your sake I hope it is not Karyn. i know a guy named Carol also, as well as a Salvadore that goes by Sally Oh my God I'm so sorry. My aunt is also named Sue and she hates that song too. Oh my goodness I bet it's beautiful! I was thinking about dying my hair teal again. Work is super awesome about it and since I wear a hat no one can really tell anyway. Cool hair all the way! My husband is 6'3', 350lbs, very long, almost to his butt salt and pepper hair. EVERYONE we meet says, ' oh I bet you ride a hog huh? ' No. He's a poet lol. I'm not kidding. I'm way more dangerous than he is lol We're from the midwest. My husband has long curly hair that he had at one point early 00's taken about the bottom six inches of and bleached it and dyed it blue. Sadly, around that time my mammaw passed away and we drove down to southeastern Kentucky for her funeral. At her wake, one of my cousins apparently made a crack about my husband's hair and one of my great uncles loudly asked this cousin if he had, in fact, ever left *insert holler here* in his entire life. I love my great uncle Before I lopped it off, I was also a cis-het mid 40s married male with luxurious locks down to my ass. I'm also a petite 5'7' 130#. Beyond just catching heat for it, I was often mistaken for female. Hated how I was hit on, but loved to see creeps turn tail & run when I would flirt back & they realized I wasn't a pretty little female. Even better when I had a DJ gig at a gay bar. I'd do drag for shows, my wife the 6' 220# amazon with deep voice would tag along. She was assumed to be a drag queen, and me a lesbian. Sure led to a lot of interesting conversations at the end of the night as we packed up gear. Women deal with entirely too much bullshit. Thank you! My everyday clothes are growing more and more girly as I'm getting more comfortable with my weight loss. My goal for this year is to update my wardrobe. Guess I have to walk around the locker room in my sports bra. It takes forever to get on but it's so worth it. Saved my ass too many times to count. Don't tell my mom. She worries enough. But you shouldn't have to do that. People should just mind their own business and let us change clothes. Do they have a family changing room? My gym has one that has shower stall like rooms for families when mom brings the boys or dad brings the girls so they don t have to change by themselves in a gender specific changing room. My PF is super chill, hopefully yours will be too! Layers are a huge help. Every time I can, I will go in a pullover and sweats. You can always shed clothes easier than changing, but that s not always practical, especially if you go after work. It s not your responsibility to placate someone else, but anxiety hardly cares whether you know that or not. For the sake of getting a good day in the gym and avoiding your own stress, it can certainly help. You shouldn t have to do that, but it might be a decent solution. I find swimming pool locker rooms to be THE most revolting places on earth. Something about wet floors. Normal gym locker rooms are okay but that wet flooring gah. Even using sandals doesn t remove how ghastly I find it. I fairly religiously change at home, wearing my suit home after a swim. The pool I started going to in November, I ve never even been into the changing rooms I hadn t thought of that. Even though I grew up in that era, and all that is true. I still think it s uncomfortable and unusual these days to have a naked stranger come up and chat. Even though locker rooms are a space set aside for being briefly naked. You are hypothesizing beyond belief. And, again, there is nothing in the original post about politics. Why are you defending somebody that made a baseless accusations by making further baseless accusations? There is absolutely nothing in the post about politics. They tell me that all the time. When I was out for a month with COVID they were fucking terrible. Gave everyone who wasn't me a hard time. So it's been very busy these last few weeks. A co-worker calls me the momma duck. Lol, yes. His name is Benny. There might be some tonight as well. My friend went from cross dressing jokes being thrown at her to married to a British professor with an adorable little boy while finishing up her degree. She s definitely won because the morons mocking her never left that hick town. When people give me shit, I look at their face then I look at their shoes and I look back at their face and shake my head and say lighty, what a fuckin loser ' Boy does that get them pissed! Then I walk away happy. You handled it like a true badass- assertive and calm. Especially given the context of having already been stressed out. U/wayok8994 My sister is a c/o and wears a very similar uniform I d imagine. Please let this slide off, this Karen isn t even worth the effort or thoughts you re putting into it. I wish you the best! From a big sister, who worries about her siblings. I'm doing my level best to ensure she has every tool in her toolbox to not just be a bad ass, but to KNOW she is. Rock on! It sounds like you already are. Good on you! Have him teach you to at least change the oil, and a flat tire, then you are a Superhero! anything more than oil/tire, may be worth learning, but with today's cars, it is almost worth it to take to a mechanic just to avoid the countless hours spent cussing, busting knuckles, and fileting the skin off your arms to get at anything under the hood, lol /s Not to mention the cost of all the special tools required to do almost anything on purpose, so you either had to buy a redundant tool, or take it to the dealer. I understand weaponized Incompetence. However, it should be used sparingly, for effect or for something they really don't like just not as a be all , goto response, lol 'Robert..' To be honest I wrote that on purpose - I'm a trans guy and I feel like writing 'cis' will clock me immediately so I made it sound as cisgender as possible so as not to be yelled at but yes! Thank you. Cisgender is correct Jive ass dude, ain't got no brains anyhow.... Call me whatever- just not early in the morning! Thankfully it's not, LOL! Two 'R's' and two 'L's' for me, like Carroll O'Connor. On the Italian side of my family we had an uncle named Salvatore his middle name was Angelo , we just called him Sal, but I've known guys names Salvatore that go by Sally, too. Funny thing is, I thought it was a really funny song, and knew all the lyrics. It s when the kids called me a boy I got upset, lol! Hehe, as my mother's only child, and her being a cosmetologist, I always let her get away with random shit. In my 19-20 years, she wanted to bleach my hair brown to platinum in 1 hr. and dye it manic panic ultra-violet. I let her. Caught shit at work constantly. LOl. My response was, hey, I am her only, and she loves messing trying new things, so I Guinua pig for her sometimes. By 21, i was def getting a bald spot, so I grew a goat, and shaved my head. A few months later, my goatee was 2 diff colors. Gotta have fun with it! My husband is 6'5, 300lbs, just all around big and wide. he gets the whole biker thing a lot. He's also bald with a goatee. He's an artist and has a Master's in Psych. Truly the sweetest guy ever. We used to have a neighbor who was terrified of him and would ask her partner at the time to go with her if my husband was out. Her partner who later became a friend told us she used to say she was afraid of him because he looked mean. She also thought he was stalking her and wanted to rape her. All that drama until she finally moved on was based solely on his looks. If you re in transition with your weight loss and have more than a couple sizes to go through, have you tried ThredUp? They have clothes that aren t expensive and can be pre-worn or even brand new. I went through a weight loss too down, then up, now on the way down again and have saved a lot of money shopping for intermediate sized clothes. You can even send clothes in to sell but you don t get much for them. When you get to your goal weight you ll have a little more $$ in the bank to buy new clothes. Ugh yeah I bet. Coming from someone in the military, we get a lot of recognition and praise from civis on the street for nothing and you guys risk your health and life on a daily basis without a second thought from everyone whom you are protecting that being civilians from the criminals . All that to say thank you for YOUR service. Your job goes unrecognized and that's a shame. You guys have it harder than 90 percent of us. Anyway, thanks for replying, this has been a fun conversation. I actually have to throw this out there, my planet fitness was so NOT chill that I had to switch gyms. Off all gyms, I think PF vary the most by location. It s just a franchise to purchase that comes with contract pricing on purple equipment and yellow wallpaper. We all have our own idea of what's normal. From their perspective, staying clothed and being uncomfortable they're naked in a locker room makes you the weird one. Republicans have politicized gender identity by introducing bathroom bills https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/anti-trans-bathroom-bills-have-nothing-do-privacy-and-everything and fear-mongering over trans people https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-10/gop-looks-to-fire-up-base-with-attacks-on-transgender-rights?leadSource=uverify%20wall . It is highly likely that the Karen in this story has bought into that fear and that s why she freaked out over a somewhat more masculine-presenting woman rather than just minding her own business. A person like OP, whether trans or not, being targeted/harassed over their gender presentation is political because Republicans have made it so. That s actually very sweet. Mutual respect goes a long way. Fuck yeah!! That's perfect. I love it. Thank you. It's been a learning experience to continue being calm during very stressful times. Hope she stays safe! I'm laughing about it now, which I guess is good. I sent a note to my therapist and she and I quickly texted a few times about it and that helped to vent about it all and everything. Fool don't want no help, fool don't get no help. My Mum used to say 'just don't call me late for dinner'. what was funny about this guy is that they spelled his name wrong on the birth certificate so it was literally 'Salva**d**ore' That's so much fun! My best friend is a cosmetologist so she likes to do stuff like that with us too. Pride month is always fun. My husband has the goatee too! Lol. It's funny because I'm SO much louder, intense etc than he is. He is soft-spoken and nicest guy. But looks scary I guess. Lol this thread reminds me of a post I read where op described this biker gang. Tough guys with tattoos, piercings, long hair and beards... And when they stopped, they started taking out of carriers these *tiny* dogs. Mini poodles, chihuahuas, spitzes... The dogs had all custom leather vests, and these big, mean looking guys were all like 'who's my baby?? You are!! Who's a good boy/girl?' In these high pitched voices. I appreciate that, thank you friend. Thank you for what you do as well. Yes! Thank you for making my day better! It really does. So walking into a shit show it takes a few weeks to get the balance back. Oh I believe it, lol. My husband cuddles his cat every night baby talking her When she sees him heading to bed she practically runs in and throws herself down on the bed next to him so he can pet her belly. He is the only one she allows to do this.",

		"body": "Mkay, first allow me preface this by stating this may not be a true Karen story. It's more so about an idiot who should not be allowed on the road. Allow me to also state that while I believe 'Karen' is a state of being, one that encompasses the whole gender, age, religious, and racial/ ethnic spectrum, this particular individual fell within the stereotypical white, middle-aged, and female demo. Hence, I argue that this still counts. Anyway, I drive a shuttle. Sometimes I shuttle passengers. Other times I am just delivering mail. So on my return, there's this grey van. They attempt to pass, but do not time it right. I literally had to hit my brakes so as to not hit them. I can never find the da *n horn in these moments, so I settled with PG, but still wild hand gestures. Anyway, we're on a highway, and said grey van apparently does not use cruise control. I do. I was maintaining a consistent speed of 72 mph. They fell below this range, so I passed. Well this must have woke them up, because they suddenly realized they needed to speed up. Naturally, they move into the passing lane and bide their time over the next mile. Then Karen does it again. This was the moment I learned she was a 'classic Karen', as I did not get a chance to peer into the vehicle the first time. To her credit there was enough space this time IF she had maintained her speed. She did not. Sigh. I move into the passing lane to avoid having to brake. Well this genius notices me doing that and moves right in front of me. What is the point of this? Either maintain a faster speed than me or don't. Anyway, we continue and come upon a closed lane blocked off for emergency services. At this point Karen has figured out how maintain distance between our vehicles. However, she is oblivious to this closure. Again, I braked a lot to give her space to get over, which she finally does at the last minute. Now I ask you dear Reddit readers. Is this simple vision problems, driving incompetence, or run-of-the-mill *ssholery?",

Thin blue line of the ozone after each use of the hairspray She looks like one of those fancy chickens The husband was definitely blinking in Morse code to the photographer I don t get that hairstyle don t they ever look in the mirror and see how crazy this looks? What in the ever loving fresh hell is this???? I will have nightmares This gives me Talladega Nights Ricky Bobby's family vibes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfLtst6mC0Q&ab _channel=3CutFilms This dude s frown-smile let s us, the viewers, know that he s fully aware of how much he would have to pay in child support with joint custody. I remember this pic aren't the kids Jayden, Aydan and some other... yden? This meme is so old it can vote 'I need to speak with your manager, right now. My husband is a cop.' she looks like a human peacock minus the beauty lmao Betty got a hot tub Dan. A Hot. Tub. And here we are, waiting another year for you to get that promotion that never comes. God mom was right. I should have married Shooter. When being a police officer is not just your entire personality, but the personality of your entire family. Such a dismal existence. Oh damn that hair. It just shouts, I m going to kill my family with an axe later today Thin blue line t shirts on all the kids he is a cop an she is heavy into selling Tupperware and Avon I guarantee Her husbands eyes look defeated. I bet the kids are bamed Hunter, Tanner and Brayden Christ, it s like she wears it like a war headdress This looks like a Mormon family from Utah in 2005 Super Saiyan Karen Isn't husband the police manager liason volunteer ? Her husband can tell you where every truckstop restroom is in a 20 mile radius. She is 100% in an MLM and that hair is where she s hiding all of the past due bills from her husband. What the actual hell is up with people actually thinking that yeye ass haircut looks good All of those people are assholes, those kids don t have a chance in hell of not being assholes Call that the I maCunt hairstyle Oof, this just *oozes* crazy Mormon energy. That poor guy. The light s gone back there, he s just trying to survive. Did she go to the salon and say 'Just fuck my shit up!'? I thought she was sitting infront of a potted plant...a fern? I've never seen a more obvious, help me, look from someone. CLASSIC Karen doo! Did that originate from that Kate makes eight or something show? She s got a fountain of hair. If she painted her hair green she'd look like she was wearing a plant on her head. The Tammy Fay effect has caused Karenism There are 4 smiles in this picture. Poor kids There used to be a fourth kid before he was devoured to feed her hairstyle. Ma am, you are single handedly destroying the Ozone layer. Dee Snider s hair found a new home. My aunt does hair in a little Texas town and every woman that sits in her chair requests a haircut similar to this. Like, all of them. It s so weird. Where did his upper lip go? In Texas we call this hairstyle.. 'higher the hair, closer to god' She's unlocked level 7 Ah yes the three brothers, Brayden, Jayden, and Hayden This pic smells like AquaNet Like from the Voodoo Glow Skulls song. I still see this hair out in the wild. Do they not know? That s hair is glorious. I hope she still has it and struts like a peacock when it public These poor kids. My god. That is a 1980s mullet to have nightmares about She looks like she's wearing a goofy looking helmet. I bet she could shake her head back and forth, and it wouldn't even move. Karyn, Daryn, Jayden, Kayden, Brayden I'm pretty sure everyone in this photo is named Ryan. she sics her kids on managers who do not yield, like Daenerys sending her dragons to go dracarys Does she use an entire can of Vo5 every day? The merca flag kids Tshirts make the Karen so much more super sized. The true home of the Karen. Magic boot locking undies. Yikes. She is the final boss of Karens. Caden, Braden and Ayden looking mfs Guaranteed those boys are named Brayden, Jayden, and Kayden. That husband beats all of them for sure. All types of yikes You just know those kids are names Rick, Ricky jr and Richard Leave it to reddit to make judgemental remarks about this woman and her family for essentially how she looks and OP's 'context', if you can even call it that. What an adorable bigoted family /s This woman has done nothing but have a hair style you see as a joke. Why post this and bully her? I hate that supporting the police has become something so political. I feel like it is common sense to not hate a whole career made to protect us just because a few people abuse that power. I absolutely support the police, but I would never get a t-shirt like that because then I would be accused of being a racist and a homophobe and all these other things I'm not. Wow! Looks like she stole Tina Turner's wig. I thought memes were only on Sundays? What the fuck is that hair? Is that real or has it been photoshopped to look like that? Karen and Kieth with their three boys, Kayden, Aiden, and Brayden. Ready for the premiere of Sonic!!! i might understand if that haircut actually looked good ? she also seems to be openly mocking that obvious crew of future baldies Braden, Jayden, and Kayden never stood a chance. I can t believe this jackass is married to another jackass The mayonnaise is spicy committee That looks like a monster. That photo is so gross. Poor kids. I'm curious about the context. Who are these people and what shit did they fuck up? Almost r/unexpectedgwennhadu I bet her cop husband is a massive POS; he s hyper aggressive on the job because he s cucked by his wife and peeked in high school. He d beat her if he could but he knows she d kick his ass. The 'I'd want to talk to your manager' hairstyle is at level 99, wow. The low budget straight to video movie Meet the Karen s Her kids look like they say 'You're disrespecting a future US army soldier' Guys I found her ultimate form https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Shamblin_Lara ! Imagine using your children as props for your own dodgy propaganda. I wonder if this family also has a group portrait with them all brandishing firearms... That's the most Karen haircut I've ever seen. I can't help but wonder if it's so saturated in hairspray it doubles as a crash helmet. Does it move when exposed to a stiff breeze? Will you impale yourself on its jagged downward-facing spikes if you try to touch it? So many questions... That family is terrifying Grooming. In multiple senses. What would scare that woman more? - cashier not accepting a coupon - black guy minding his business parked near her house - another woman with a larger house and larger hair - a spider Those poor kids The husband looks like 40-60 split between lochlyn munro and Fred Stoller The husband isn't smiling! The husband has the look of, yea I married this woman. Look at my face, trust me this a smile. Come on why don t you believe I m happy? I guarantee one of those kids is named Connor and one is named Kayden. Possibly two. Picturing that hairdo scurrying across the Starbucks floor and lunging at the Barista over the counter r/justfuckmyshitup I know it s a Karen cut but this is exceptionally bad. Is that Jamie from the Geico commercials? That's him when he's smiling. You don't want to see him mad. He's got that 'someone kill me now' smile goin. ...and her sons Brayden, Cayden, and Jayden. Watched a video the other day where a Karen was upset about a 1A auditor filming her in public. The dispatcher is telling her she has no expectation of privacy in public she says on the phone to 9-1-1 'I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE 911 SUPERVISOR THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!' She walks into Super Cuts and says I want you to give me the most unattractive cut possible. Just fuck my shit up. I want hair so ugly that people fear me . the haircut that lets you know she's ruined all 4 of those men for life Baby you re a firework. Here s what three inches and 18 teeth makes when it s 2-4-1 s at Friday s. This has been reported to the OP's furious mother. She's got her hand squeezing his balls in this picture That *HAIR*!! They all the cops when the cops pull them over. All 3 of those kids look like they're named Jackson or Boston and will grow to be the biggest pricks in the 1st grade I know for a fact this boy's names are Braiyden,Kaiyden and Jaiyden I d like to speak to the mayor and the commissioner It s not even an attractive hair style. Like why would you do this to yourself AND be so self entitled. She needs to talk to Mr. Nimbus. He controls the police. I ll give her this, she s dedicated  Why does she want to wear a mini pampas bush upside down on her head? She looks like a Polish Chicken https://imgur.com/5Q5HDLi https://imgur.com/5Q5HDLi 'This is the form I use to call for a manager. And this...is the form I use to ask for the district manager. And this...is...to go...even further beyond!' Something about grooming you said? Where do they live? The 90s hair is just catching up now? Yikes That dude s eyes he s seen some shit. r/bossfight Ultimate Karen. She is definitely a karen. He looks like he offers 16 year old cashiers back massages. I don t know these people but I fuckin hate em That man does not look thrilled with his situation Did she brush her hair with a taser? Saltine lookin MFs I couldn't ever imagine wanting to have hair that feels like how her hair probably feels and I wouldn't want to touch someone's hair like that either. What a pack of assholes I wonder what type of bird her mother was? All her friends & the hair dresser lied to her. She thought she looked wicked cool walking out of the salon with her new really big, color blocked/frosted smiling head. Her husband doesn't even know what the hell he's in bed with but on the bright side, her sons can find her quickly in a PTA meeting. The most suburban thing that ever suburbed. Spear and MAGIC HELMET! Looks like the mail man predator from TCAP She s the regional manager of all Karens and that s considered a beautiful family where im from You can literally see the light fading from this man s eyes. And they accuse everyone else of indoctrination and grooming kids... Looks like my step sister Shannon Edmonds from Patterson Ca Holy shit, is this what happened after Gepetto s spider plant wished to become a real girl? Dad hates her hair. Why do they think that haircut is flattering? DoNt iNdOcTrinATe mY KiDs Look at those future serial killers Brayden, Chayden, & Slayden. If All Lives Matter was a family photo That's a Rod Stewart hair cut The *Police Keep Us Safe From Brown People* greeting card. She blew her hair out so much she looks like a live action Rodger in drag from American Dad My goal in life is to never end up with a family like this living in suburbia. Is it a law that they have to pick the worst hairstyle imaginable? Little does her husband know, but they have a fourth child. She's been hiding her in that hairdo for over a year. As if plastering your political opinions across your chest wasn't trashy enough, you went and plastered them across your infant children's chests instead. Fucking tasteless He s sitting right next to her lol Rumor is her hair kept getting bigger and bigger. Now her husband and three kids are all residing in it. Why are the ones who have conspiracies about a globalist police state worship the actual police? Imagine this guy asking her on a date... Why do these spineless looking men always have a wife that looks like she'd jump through the photo to scream at you about something innane? Holy shit the racism coming from this picture is radioactive I cannot believe thats actually her hair It pains me how letting kids see drag queens in public places is somehow 'grooming,' but dressing them in blue line shirts and presumably sticking a gun in their hands and shoving religion down their throats at 6 years old isn't. cadyn kevyn bevyn would be the kids names Is there a hairspray shortage? I feel like she would cause one Do you think she has to feed that hair doo mice like some kind of blonde bird of prey? Brayden, Jayden and Kayden. These are my sons: Aiden, Braiden, and Hayden His dead behind the eyes thousand yard stare tho. They ll be in contact with her for her hair occupying restricted airspace She looks like the wife equivalent of those birds that replace other birds eggs with their own and have larger size so the other birds prioritize them over their own young. Cuckoo wife She must ve killed the previous Karen Queen and inherited her powers. She looks like the kind of woman who doesn t return a shopping cart because it helps with job security. That s a Karen in Super Saiyan To think they accuse Democrats of indoctrinating. This picture screams racists. Those poor kids. Doomed to grow up to be assholes. Bet she whips this photo out while screaming at the cop that pulled her over. 'No I won't show you my ID I didn't do anything'...smash, zap ...'why are you doing this to me?' Can we take a minute to think that this family might be empathetic and kind. Are we now just referring to a certain haircut, or demographic, or race with being assholes? I think there s a word for it ahh it s called stereotyping. Can you see how his eyes cry for help? I don t understand how a person might think that she actually looks even a little bit attractive. Wow.. just horrible That man smile looks like hes being held hostage What secrets is she keeping in that? The fuck is that? He had procreated will h her willingly! I see 3 future Oath Keepers members Husband really regrets so many of his life choices The boys names from right to left: Kayden, Jayden and of course little Brayden. The Karens have combined their power to produce one super Karen. 'Trans people groom children' She looks ready for a cock fight. What the fuck is that palm tree haircut? I did not know Karens were able to go Super Saiyan. Look at that hair.... Karen has gone ss2 at least. She plucks those eyebrows much more it will be a full ss3. Her hair is impossibly way too big, like wtf why When the Lv80 Legendary Karen spawns at the end of the world boss meta-event. This photo screams family annihilation documentary Alpha Karen can break actual glass with her outrage. StOp InDoCtRiNaTiNg My KiDs The parents in that photo are Karen and Daryn, and the kids are Haydyn, Kaydyn, and Braydyn. Change my mind. It looks like her hair is going to fly off of her head at any second! I guarantee she's a terrible cook, too. I've seen their 'cooking' tiktoks lol. Maybe why the husband looks so miserable? That guy is about to owe a LOT of child support. This looks like one of them pics they post after the dad kills the entire family She needs to be arrested for that hair. Her hair looks like a chicken my gram had when I was growing up. I hated that bird, it was mean as hell. Dude forgot how to smile... Jareth from Labryinth Karen with her sons Braden, Kaden, Jaden and husband Dan, all smelling of lavender and other calming essential oils for this photo shoot because so help me if any one of you ruins this special day for Mommy..... Well, that guy is dead inside. You will not disrespect me in front of my sons Jaedyn Braedyn and Aedyn! A million dollars says dads white t-shirt says 'let's go brandon' across the front. He's still mad Karen made him cover it up with his 'Nice' blue shirt. A million dollars says dads white t-shirt says 'let's go brandon' across the front. He's still mad Karen made him cover it up with his 'Nice' blue shirt. Dad's 'smile' 'family photos are for pussies, I'm not a pussy, I'm buying that laser sight for my M249saw, I don't care if she says no.' The hair says it all she looks like a rooster that lost a fight He s definitely a cop. Her haircut screams you can t talk to me like that, my husband is a cop . Dude looks shell shocked. Imagine your wife went n got that haircut now you just gotta live with it even tho she s not a Karen. Or is she when you re not around? I can just tell by the photo that the youngest is her favorite. This family has a very high pH level. You can literally see the light fading from his eyes. She sits in the front row of a batist church all day Sunday but is swilling wine all day Saturday and is in the local sex shop on Friday to get new marital aids wHiTe pEoPLe bAd but im not racist. Ok, that's funny ngl Cough*nazis*cough I'm thinking this must be an old picture that hasn't dated well. She must hate seeing her hair like that now She looks like a spooked spider That couple looks like a Dateline episode waiting to happen. Isn t this as racist as calling POC in baggy clothes, felons, criminals, or even the N word? ...did that dude marry his grandmother's friend? I'm not sure what it is about that hairstyle but it makes her look *at least* 60. That's 'Karen Haircut Gone Wild.' I cant believe women do that to their hair and think it looks good. Source: am woman As a minimum wage employee i am in tears looking at this photo. Dude looks unhappy as shit I bet she has a 'Boy Mom' bumper sticker. I feel sorry for their future wives. She will try to control the relationships and will be in constant competition with the wives for her sweet, little boy's love. Hedgehog I force my political beliefs on my children and demand they express them through clothing. Poor guy, her husband. He even has his smile upside down Her hair be looking like a firework This hairstyle has never looked good on anyone. Like EVER! In her life that woman has said at least 100 times 'my husband is a cop' in relation to some crap she's trying to get away with. Is it me or does hubby look a little scared? please God tell me that s not real The poor man in this picture looks like he's fighting for his life trying to get that smile on his face. All these kids have really weird names, as I recall. I m sure they drive a reasonable vehicle void of any stickers. Why does she have a dead porcupine on her head?! Do you remember a show in the late 80s- early 90 s that had people dressed like animals? She reminds me of the green bird lady! That hair will haunt me. I feel like it s a weird homage to John Cena as Peacemaker. That poor dude looks so defeated The looks on that man s face . Hide the pain Paul Blue? Must be democrats. Yuck! Lol so stupid but I can't stop laughing. Ah the Kate Gosselin generation Poor kids Gross looking family Southern Illinois?? She s smiling big because she successfully just got a bunch of books banned from her kids school library. Oh yes, a lovely family of Dim Blue Racist. Is that Trixie Mattel She reminds me of Kerrigan from StarCraft. Ryker, Brayden, and Brixley are gonna lose that youthful grin so much faster than other children. If there is a god, he abandoned us long ago I bet they're all in various MLMs too. Utah is not a good place to be a woman. The bigger the hair, the closer to God. I'm European and I thought that this picture was a joke and that no one actually looks like this in their day-to-day life. The fact that some do and that it's considered an everyday occurrence in some parts of the world is fascinating to me. These are definitely Mormons. White t shirt says it all All the girls at Dixie state looked like this when I attended back in 2006 deleted 90 s called and wants its haircut fad back. Jesus it s called Googling current trends and allowing your hair to evolve! My very first thought upon seeing this picture: These people live in Utah. She looks like she s looking for the manager of worms and seeds. Helllooooooo Provo! > grew up in a very Mormon neighborhood Any good soaking? Her hair looks like fireworks The higher the hair the closer to God She looks like Nancy Grace... or her ugly sister, which would be weird because Nancy is a double-bagger herself. Pretty sure he s a pig too judging by the boot licker shirts the kids are wearing. I laughed. Good one. Thanks. L-A-T-O-R-T-U-R-A deleted With his eyes, or with his upper lip? It matches their personality It s like a puffer fish. It knows what s it s doing. If they can t see how crazy their public behaviour is how will they be capable of seeing how crazy they look? Not only a Karen but a Mormon Karen You talking about Braedon, Aidon, or Kaiden? IM ALL JACKED UP ON MOUNTAIN DEW Thank you sweet baby Jesus. 1 hj per year on his birthday, and she wears a latex glove and uses vaseline Why does it look like those are his bottom teeth in his smile lol will* Nah, he has to have something to beat when he gets home. Prayden I literally was coming to post you just know those kids are called something like brayden Jayden and kayden And they all have gluten allergies and aren t vaccinated Jayden, Ayden, and Brayden or maybe Grayden . No, the dad is Jayden. The kids are Brayden, Aiden, and Okayden. Brock, Kyle, and Cody Gayden And it votes republican. So a regular female peacock. The males got the eye feathers She actually has good bone structure but that thing on the top of her head makes it all for naught Wouldn't a female peacock be a peacunt? Would that be considered mariticide or parricide? Lmao We could never be that lucky Nah, she wouldn t kill the husband. They re first cousins! *essential oils Except too few kids. She s really trying to puff that hair out to level 3. With the glory whole lotta love. Poor guy? Poor kids, if anything. There s her new nickname. Fern gully. From who? The kids? And one grimace. Into her bitchy gaping craw. True deplorables are proud of it. Only if it's still 1981. Is that brand even still sold? I'm not sure, I've never been inside of a Dollar General. Yep. Round my way we call it fascism. Judging people purely by their appearance. You're duuuu^ uuuumb They are also pushing those bootlicking thin blue line shirts on the kids. If she's got that hair style and loves cops, she's probably every bit as bad as the meme indicates. Just saying. Unfortunately, that flag has come to represent all the stuff you listed. It also represents a fundamental shift in how police are trained and how they interact with the public, turning away from relationship-based community policing to an 'us versus them' mentality. You can see it in how they refer to the public as 'civilians', as if they were not also civilians, along with the extreme militarization. It's hard to support a group of people who have decided to treat us as the enemy. That said, I do have respect for those police who are trying to improve the system. There are a lot more of them than people realize, but we're still a long way from being 'ok'. As long as a fired cop can move 30 mins down the road and start policing again, we're not ok. The police have gotten themselves into this situation and they're going to need to get themselves out of it. Shit like this photo is definitely not it, in case you weren't sure. If you think that the cops that cover for dirty cops aren't dirty, you may as well stop lying to yourself and others and just get the fucking blue line shirt. No. No, it does not. Tina is an amazing person who is beautiful and so is her hair, fake or real. She has entirely too much self-respect to ever go around with that exploded looking pile of porcupine quill shit anywhere near her, let alone on her head. This goofy woman looks like Nancy Grace or her even uglier sister. Or Jaxsynn/Jaxson. So half of them moved to Utah, most are in MLMs, and a couple are doing their own photography business. No shame to them exactly, but they're all using amateur level cameras on auto but advertising $150 'mini sessions' thinking they're on par with pro photographers. All of them married the summer or two after high school, none went to college, but all their husbands went to BYU. I'm sad for them. Utah is not a good place to be ~~a woman~~. Multi Level Marriages? Utah is not a good place to be anything, really. Worse to be a Mr Karen. If he has no backbone. nah utah is beautiful. women are actually half the problem there. Does that make Dolly Parton Jesus? Half of the families at my kid's elementary school look like this. Hairspray is king in Texas. along with crazy Christo-Fascists Hey homie, if you want to see this look in the wild, come to northern Nevada. People wear the American flag on their shirt sleeves and ball caps--'Grunt Style.' It sounds like shit because it is. Also you'll see this look on the husband's shiny Dodge Ram 2500 and the wife's Chevrolet Traverse. Their house will have a few Jesus crosses and plenty of signs about *Faith* and *Family*. Oh man I just noticed the kids have it too. Poor kids don't even get to pick out their own undies. They're required to wear two shirts? In a cult, you say? Whoa that's so much creepier, I didn't notice the matching blue shirts with white t shirts underneath. Real death cult vibes in this picture. I don't know. They could also be Midwest, small-town, church-going folk. Looks just like 'em. Don't let that fool you, either. What s wrong with white tshirts That is the absolute best case scenario to riding your motorbike without a helmet. Wear a helmet. I did a project in a small town in south Georgia about ten years ago. The fashions were from twenty years earlier and the fancier the person was the more they leaned into it. Whenever I went to one of the nice restaurants, every woman in there looked like she was auditioning for the mom in Home Alone. So weird. Edit: it makes sense that the fashions would be most obvious in people with money, in that everyone else probably bought their clothes at Walmart or Target, both of which stock contemporary clothing. But it suddenly occurs to me to ask: Where the hell did they get their clothes? These kinds of people typically settle on the one style when their lives peaked and they never, ever change. I STILL see boomer men with that middle-parted 80's hair. I don't want to know. Lol I was part of the non-mormon minority. They were very secretive so I didn't find out what that was until I was an adult. They'd have social events for all the teens in a few temples, didn't realize those were essentially match-making events. Tease it to Jesus! Nancy Gross A *what* You mean Braedon, Kaedon, and Kodi? This might be the one case where the cops spouse beats him rather than the other way around. Judging the entirety of the scene, he is not a cop. The wife's boyfriend is. And they're probably his kids. This stupid fuck doesn't even know his own name. Imagine Braxston asks you what the shirt you bought him means, and you explain to him that 'radical black leftists are endangering the brave men and women who are the only thing that stand between our family's home and an anarchist society, we live a paranoid existence that perceives a precarious state of near-civil-war at all times prevented only by our important and blind political support of law enforcement' then he asks why he can't have a minecraft shirt instead I like that boot licker has come back. It's so damned insulting. Since he's on the force. He can't ever tell anyone what he has seen. it screams, 'you need to address me by my husband's rank' Tyler, Skyler, or Kyler? Dude, what s wrong with you. Stop mischaracterizing Mormon culture. Their kids will all have the same first letter of their name, as will their parents. I legit knew a Kevin married to a Karen with kids named Kelly, Kaden, Kaleigh, and Kelsey I think? . Smile like Fire Marshall Bill. deleted yell 'Brayden!' at a school yard and you'll get a stampede of 8 year olds Probably a Raiden in there somewhere. Me too You want to eliminate the next generation? Crop dust the playground with peanuts. Yeah I think that was it. Multiple times. In different US states. While yelling something about 'but muh dem's voter fraud!' And why did I not know there would be someone putting in their political 2 cents. the kids don't deserve this.. The father LOL. Yes . Cvs sells it This is really what I was going for. You said it way better than I could. Wow, that was unnecessarily agressive. Let me try this again. Police are a good thing. There are great cops out there. There are bad cops out there. The bad cops are dragging the whole system down and need to go. The good cops put their lives at risk every day to keep us safe. I absolutely support those people. That's all I'm saying. Why is it *always* photography? Lol my dad graduated from byu 30 years ago and married my uneducated mother. Good to see things never change. I WAS pro. Had some international magazine covers and all that, felt like I was doing alright. Then this influx began. At first I thought hey cool, the more the merrier, the barrier to entry dropped and I thought all the fresh blood would advance the art. I even took on anyone interested to learn, taught some free lighting workshops and did my best to be as welcoming as possible. Then some of the very live laugh love karens who took me up on it all and learned what they could tried poaching some of my clients, bad mouthing me and my skill in the local community and saying how much better they were. Annoying but fine, it s not like they had the connections to get commercial work and wedding clients were a headache anyway, especially the ones most focused on saving money. But it exploded from there. The bottom dropped out of the local market and everyone s photos looked like the exact same washed out soft tan barnyard-chic on furry white rugs gaggy crap. So much for advancing the art. Instead of the community of artists exchanging ideas that I had hoped for, we had a hundred Karens all bad mouthing each other as well as the long-established studios trying to all sell the same fucking mini sessions. I bailed on the whole thing. The final straw was when I made the mistake of partnering with one of them who I was dating at the time let her focus on the family stuff while I handled the commercial work, and then she predictably did the cliche thing and cheated, told everyone she was moving to her new crushes town because it was the best thing for her kids, and on her way out the door she stole a lot of my equipment. I lost my taste for that medium entirely and shifted to Astro on a hobby level. The community there is encouraging of each other and the most bitching we hear is after a couple weeks of clouds. Sounds like the plot of Dont Worry Darling Fact. But it is pretty Source: born and raised in Utah She could cut her hair bald and she'd still be Jesus Wait you didn't know? My bad dude I thought we told you Oh wow, here the mothers I see drop off their children at school don't tend to bother with hairspray. Here it's mostly messy buns and other hairstyles that don't take too much time. Probably mormons, but none of the white shirts visible here are going to be the religious garment worn by adult members of the Church of Jesus Christ. Those are all just regular white t-shirts. Especially the ones for the kids, but also the father and mother here. I suppose there is a very slight chance that s not the case on the father. Regardless - for a coordinated family picture, since when do kids get to pick their outfits, lol? Magic underwear. They have strict beliefs around modesty. Although as an agnostic who practices modesty, I hate promoting the belief that modesty = Mormon or even religious at all. The women wear a silk under dress that is never supposed to touch the ground. Nothing. But theirs are special magic t-shirts. A double-bagger. That's where a person is so fugly, you put a bag on your own head, as well as their head, in case their bag tears or comes off. Hunter, Maverick, and Goose. Probably a source of her Karen complex as well. It s 430 in the morning and this comment has already made my whole day so much better lol She locks his chastity belt every morning before work Plot twist: she's the cop Ransym, Kamdyn, or Branch. Morning, Dad... lmao Raiden Shadow Ledgynd Their shirts are political. What country are you from? Because they think they re being creative when they know they aren t creative people. Point and shoot baby! It's so easy to take a mediocre photo, that's why Photog here: Let me tell you. They straight up ruin us. Their $50 mini sessions or 'sesh' to them are uninspired and generic. I get sent the photos asking me to 'fix them' Every time I'd shoot a wedding there'd be at least one of them there trying to critique my every movement. 'make sure you get a shot of this' isn't helping. If I wanted a supervisor I'd hire one. Photographers ruined photography for me. I still do work for hire, but on my own terms. They're at the age when friends take engagement, wedding and baby pictures and think they can make more than $1000 by getting in on it then they don't, then they eventually quit The Mormon church has always really encouraged women to document everything in a happy way of course for family and church purposes. It explains the huge amount of successful mormon bloggers and IG people. And to a further extent, the genealogy obsession, congrats to everyone that handed over that data for a 23&Me test When I see most 'photographers' work all I can think is why am I not doing this because all of these people suck. All it takes is a camera of any kind and the Dunning Krueger effect. So, are you half stupid? Holy shit I m so sorry. It doesn't help that most photog YouTube channels cater to beginners and the ignorant. Tony and Chelsea Northrup, FStoppers, and so many more want to sell you something rather than teaching. I'll never forget FStoppers not know what dodging and burning was and to never shoot the sunset facing the sun. Just like everywhere else, it's the people that ruin it. People. What a bunch of bastards. I need to hike more in UT is so pretty! Moab is amazing but just so crowed these days Definitely Mormons. This photo pops up here from time to time. I don t think most people know about the magic underwear. >modesty = Mormon or even religious I had no idea, thank you. I must know a ton of Mormons. There's a video from Cu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUpSP1WVR84 t of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab saying that she enjoys practicing modesty because she likes that she can control what people see of her, which I thought was a really good way to think about modesty outside of a religious perspective. That s inaccurate, FYI. For both men and women who wear the religious garment, it resembles a shirt and shorts. The shorts come down to the knee or just slightly above or below. As the other reply explained, it has mostly to do with promoting modesty, as they are supposed to be fully covered by the outer layer of clothes. I can't tell if this is a joke or not. Do Mormons really have 'magic' clothes? thats why plastic bags are superior. you can tie the handles in a knot under their chin. if you do it right, 'one and done!' you forgot Ice Ouch...which one is goose and why do they wish death upon him? Lowgyn, Rawynne and Gyophry I'm from the US. It's also cheap to get into, and easy to look competent enough to people with little to no knowledge in the area. I am in this comment. Actually good talented photography is a sight to see. Masculinity works the same way with guns. Do they quit, or do they just run out of clients once all of their friends are married and bred? And they usually think it'll be easy. SOOOO DIFFERENT WHEN THE CLIENTS AREN'T YOUR FRIENDS. Takes SO much planning, equipment, discussion of expectations, contracts and receipts... Hell, I only ever did ONE wedding. It was for a friend, and it was a disaster because she didn't hold up to 90% of her end of the planning and didn't tell me. That was the day I decided I would NEVER get into wedding photography. Noooo thanks. Oh my God, Dunning Kruger Photography would be a great name for an MLM photography business I didn't know what the Dunning-Kruger effect was... And definitely helps to explain why I undervalued my work so much. Very interesting. Low intelligence /= Ignorance or lack of education. I graduated with honors and am only 2 of 4 children to have even graduated from college. but your statement might still be true. lol People are the fuckin *worst*. There's nothing worse than people. I mean, yeah. I said probably, but chances are slim that these aren t mormons. Even so the white shirts here especially on the woman and children are just plain shirts. They aren t the religious undergarments worn by faithful adult members of the church. She should be free to wear whatever makes her happy, just as long as there aren't morality police forcing her to wear a particular outfit. I appreciate that! I am nonreligious, an atheist but I practice a version of modesty for myself and have another friend who does the same. I would never project it onto anyone else or judge what they do though. But I do think that if it's viewed as a choice a woman can make for herself outside of religion, more women may consider it and find it rewarding or comfortable. Modesty and also, it's magically bulletproof What Is Mormon Underwear? https://allthatsinteresting.com/mormon-underwear-temple-garment I m Lysa with a Y. I used to like it until it became obnoxious. Are you a cop? Related to a cop? Friends with cops? You sound like a cop. And doesn t require an education. Like real estate. Yeah that is true. Sometimes people use fake photos to advertise and what families get is completely different Me to. We should speak to the manager of Reddit. There s always time for divorce! That's more like imposter syndrome yeah, kind of a dumb statement considering that I was referring to my parent's education levels and not mine. People in oversized suv,s never missing their exit on a crowded freeway It s meant to be a protection, but obviously not as body armor. It s spiritual protection, and it relates to covenants with God that we hold sacred. For what it s worth, I for one would appreciate if fewer people mocked it like this. Thanks, that s a helpful link for anyone genuinely curious about it. I guess it's just that every in person interaction I've had with a cop has been a pleasant interaction. I'm not denying that there are bad cops, I just don't think they're the majority That woman s husband totally gives off a real estate agent vibe. Possibly even Realtor. does real estate acquire an education? There's so many reports of Mormons claiming it's stopped bullets, kept them afloat after an ocean accident, and other crazy things that I'm not even going to link to them, they're so easy to find. Y'all brought this upon yourselves. If you don't like how people aren't taking your beliefs seriously, idk, have more sane beliefs. Judging by the kid's shirts, I bet he's a cop. Most places require a class to take. My wife had to do 30-40 hours of classes and pass a test. Agreed. My dad had to take classes and pass a test So you re making fun of mormons because you can find a handful of exceptional stories online? Exceptional things happen. Whether someone believes surviving an extreme situation is because they were faithful to their beliefs does you absolutely no harm and doesn t justify unkindness. Porque no los dos? Judging by the kids shirts, I bet he s a cop that stands by and watches his colleagues violate the constitution and lets other cops get away with DUI. Lol religion and religious beliefs do almost nothing BUT harm others. Mockery is one of the many weapons we have to get some people who've been groomed since childhood to believe that their sky daddy makes it OK to be awful, and I'll continue to use it. A real estate cop? The hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness there is astounding. Mockery generally does nothing to convince someone against an idea anyway, so you ve got that all wrong as far as motivations go. Asking you to be respectful is about promoting mutual understanding and coexisting peacefully despite differences in belief. It has nothing to do with protecting fragile beliefs, for me or anyone else. Like I said, I d appreciate less mockery, but if you ve already decided on zero understanding or cooperation, then my message isn t really for you. It s for people who care about progress. I don't see how I'm a hippocrite, and I'm very self-aware, thank you. I've tried your way in the past but religion is super dangerous and society can't afford to humor it anymore. I don't care to coexist with anyone who sees my friends as less than them because their heads are up some pastor's/god's ass. Progress comes when we put the toys away and tell the kids Santa isn't real. Until then, it's a world full of people justifying their awful ways with some absurd absurd belief system instead of taking a critical look at the world and realizing that maybe they should think for themselves for once. Cool that it makes you feel some random comfort while trans kids are being murdered in god's name. I'm not the one backing an organization with quite a lot of blood on its hands. > I don't see how I'm a hippocrite, and I'm very self-aware, thank you. Impressive. Thanks, I get that a lot!",

		"body": "So I have had a few Karen encounters since I was 12. So this is like any other. I've been working in fast food since I was 14 1/2 so I guess I know how to deal with one. So basically I work at the front desk of a family dental care place because that's the only income I currently have while I pay for college and my apartment. So this Karen has a appointment for 3:30 pm for her and 3:45 for her son, they arrive at 3 and get checked in by me. In most dental places your usually called in by the doctor a little bit after your appointment time, and since these guys came early I just told them to wait a for a bit and the doctor will be with them shortly. At around 3:15 or so she walks up to me and starts talking to me in a aggressive way about how she needs to leave fast because of her sons basketball practice. I kindly tell her she has to wait because we have to help other patients. She goes back to her seat, and she gives me a death stare. After 5 minutes she comes back again and this time she's shouting about how she needs her appointment, and I kindly tell her again she needs to wait for her and her son's turn because her appointment is in 10 minutes. If she wanted she could have booked a spot a bit earlier so she could be treated. At this point she's shouting enough to make someone's ears bleed and starts shouting she wants to talk to the head of the office and she basically just walk through the door that takes you to the hallways where the patients rooms are. At shit point we can't legally take her back so we had to call security to take her back and have a guard stay with her as she's causing a lot of problems. Karen's are annoying",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* Classic. I have a hundred stories like this from working in the ER. Its as if waiting rooms make people lose all perception of time and go crazy. Mind you, the current practice of having patients come in a half-hour early for their appointment and then making them wait 30 minutes or more after the scheduled time to actually see a practitioner and then be rushed through with no chance to discuss anything or ask any questions gets pretty damned annoying too. About 7 years ago when I was going through the beginning stages of my divorce, I get a call from our family doctor asking why my ex her name is Karen BTW... was having a meltdown in her office. The office opens at 9am, but the doctor did not come in until 10, she had bust in the office right at 9, demanded to see the doctor she did not have an appointment , the receptionist told her the doctor was not in yet, my ex did not believe her, stormed into the doctor's office, saw the doctor was not there, came back out to the reception area and completely freaked out, the police were called but my ex left before they came, I later get a call from the police asking where she was, as they wanted to have a 'chat' with here. Thank god I got myself and my kids away from that shit. was it a psychiatrist's office? Who has security guards at a dental practice? I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure she was technically committing a crime. Even if you are on a property legally, it is illegal to enter any area within that property that you are not authorized to enter. For example, if I enter a theme park as a guest with a valid ticket, and then enter an area within that theme park that is marked 'Authorized Personnel Only,' I am committing a crime. At shit point for a sec I thought that was the name of your dental office not a typo Did she get kicked out before her appointments? I hope she got charged double cancellation fees for both my dentist charges $50 lol Dentist should release her from care. Am I the only one who is used to a doctor's office never seeing me at the appointment time? Even when I get there early, I just start reading Reddit on my phone because I know I'm never going to be seen at the time I booked. And I damn sure know better than to have a tight schedule on a doc appointment day. Is there a doctor's office that exists where people actually get seen at the exact time they're scheduled for? If so, tell me where that is. Apparently this has worked for Karen s in the past & they keep trying it. These people need to start being sent to jail for this behavior, even if just for a couple hours. Live & learn baby. Imagine having to be babysat by security. Yikes, what a nut Wait you mean to tell me she wasn't the most important one there? Her son's sports practice was clearly what everyone's day should've revolved around! I love it when they show up early and then get all up in their feelings because they don t get to come back early. Sis, you have an appointment time for a reason. In my office, that behavior would ve gotten her dismissed and shown out the door in quick order. I don t play. Hahaha beautiful I love stories where it s an independently owned business and the Karen gets put in their place for their shitty behaviour as there s no corporate desperately trying to cater to these adult tantrums. 'Ma'am, please sit down and wait your turn or you'll have a greater need for dental work than you do right now.' You just reminded me to leave a good review for my new endodontist, thanks! Office staff doesn't get enough good reviews. Can you recommend a good thank you gift for office staff? We have a big screen for occupied rooms that has a few signs to tell us who needs labs, EKGs, and how long they've been there. When a patient or family member comes out to complain about how long they've been there, I have multiple doctors who will be like, 'Which room?' When they say the room, they'll point at the screen and go,'it says you've been here only an hour' or however long it says they've been there, which normally isn't very long as we're a freestanding ER. They often get angrier, but they'll go. 'Why are you mad? It's factual that you've been here only that long. It's not improper of me to let you know this when you're claiming you've been here twice as long.' Or they act like they personally rented out the place for their appointments I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HOURS Sir it s been 11 minutes please have a seat So I can understand the ER one, sometimes that's an insane amount of pain to be told to sit and wait. Plus you can't make an appointment for ER. I spent 6 hours in the waiting room with my shoulder out of the socket and it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. I had go to the ER so many times between seizures and tearing up my shoulder from the seizures to the point I was on a first name basis with a lot of the ER staff lol. To be clear, I still didn't walk around and demand to be seen, but I totally understand why someone would in a situation like that. I think often it's more of a pain thing than a waiting room kind of thing. The dentist office on the other hand? Just a wait lol she could have managed waiting 30 min. for her checkup. Except lately its been crazy. NO excuse to act like a Karen. But a few weeks ago I fell on my face yes I'm very grateful and my sunglasses split the top of my nose open. I went the ER... 16 hour wait from register to Dr. So I checked neighboring hospital. Only 11 hours. NOT anyone's fault but waiting for hours and hours is different than 15 min at a Dr There does seem to be a disconnect. 30 minutes early is probably because more people are late than not. Also, paperwork, insurance costs, etc. The doctor is the most expensive piece of equipment and part the doctor s billings go to paying the team However it s STILL annoying The dental office my BFs mom works at is in a hospital so they have security. There are some in my area is mall type set ups and some of them also have security. I feel like it just depends on the location and set up ig One where the desk guy has been dealing with Karens long enough to know he needs one Yea we were told that but we decided not to press charges as a warning. But I doubt she has stoped The time scheduled for a doctor s appointment is a perfect representation of what in bistromathics is called a *recipriversexclusion* - that is, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. A 10:30am doctor s appointment, for example, means the one point in time you are guaranteed to ***NEVER*** see the doctor will be 10:30am. The same principle applies to restaurant reservations. If you are kept waiting in the ER, be happy. This tells you that your condition is not as serious as others. ERs treat patients according to degree of need, not in the order of arrival. When I worked in a hospital, I would enter thru the ER entrance. One afternoon, I walked in and the bulletproof glass at the reception desk was shattered. It seemed that one patient lost his patience and karate chopped the glass. Was removed wearing those infamous silver bracelets. 'Why did you help those people before me?! Are you just retaliating against me because I stood up for myself?!? you all think you can gaslight me but I'm not crazy!!!' I don't know where I heard this but 'How long a minute is is dependent on which side of the bathroom door you are on.' Yes our dental place is in a mall. You speak the truth 'I've been coming here for over 29 years you better let me have my appointment right this instant.' 'Ma'am we have been open for 29 years' 'Shit, tonny get in the car, NOW!' Awesome! That sure came in handy! I m sure every dental office wishes they had security for Karen s! Lmao I'm happy who knows what would have happened. At that time we had 3 patients undergoing a tooth removal process and they were on anasthetics. That would have been a huge safety hazard if she got in or near the rooms. A doctor should never be disturbed during surgery",

I had to show him the rule book so he understood. Same ad those idiots in the 80's that thought DnD was satanic lol. Ppl don't understand something so you're a cultist. Have a pride flag or shirt? You must be gay. Ppl are just dumb Sometimes I wish I had half the confidence of these weirdos, going around joining unrelated conversations with strangers, commenting on their sexuality. I mean, I wouldn't do what they do, it's ridiculous, but they must have so much confidence doing that. I have trouble saying hi to someone I see on the streets every day. I wouldn t be surprised if she s a member of a church that s actually kinda cultish, brainwashing bigotry into the members So is it a cult? Damn Karens. This is why Fazbear pizza loses business! ***Fazbear entertainment cannot confirm nor deny these rumors.*** I must be the only one here who has no idea what a 'FNaF' is. Did she actually say 'FNaF? How do you pronounce that?' Dude if she said that she hasnt mentioned gender even once. If ur lgbtqia+ you should atleast know the difference and get your story straight pun not intended Reminds me how when my mom found out I liked fnaf she said it was satanic and that if I kept watching markiplier play I would become a bad person I know I'll take heat for this but 1.

Lmao this would be a great copypasta The old saying about assuming is half right in this case, because she certainly made an ass of herself. Wow, she managed to infantilize the asexual person without even knowing they were asexual. A polite please mind your own business you fucking boomer cunt would have been appropriate What a nosy bitch, the one place you don t interrupt people is when they re eating food Their I just want to speak up for 40 something year old women- we don't claim her. Honest to god... Does anyone ever say Fuck off and mind your own business , anymore? I sure do. In all fairness I m a big barrel chested man. A cult? Like Christianity? Nah lmao I mean a LOT of FNaF fans are LGBT but what the frick. I'm pretty sure I've seen 8 year old fans of FNaF and forcing labels onto kids yeesh Why is anyone carrying a flag regarding their sexual orientation in the first place? That's their business and no one else's. And it would avoid a huge amount of discussions. I would have spit on her then said 'ha! Now YOU'RE gay!'  Who isn t in the Cult of Fazbear? She will have her frontal lobe sacrificed in the hopes that Freddy Fazbear will return after being dismantled AC/DC stands for Anti-Christ/Devil s Children and KISS stand for Knights In Satan s Service AC/DC stands for Anti-Christ/Devil s Children and KISS stand for Knights In Satan s Service AC/DC stands for Anti-Christ/Devil s Children and KISS stand for Knights In Satan s Service 'I'm right, you're gay' <- shit I didn't know this is how it worked, maybe the salty gamer 10 year olds were right The best thing to do is double down and make them far more uncomfortable than they can make you. 'I hate what I fear and I fear what I don't understand.' Sounds like how my parents banned me from Bendy and The Ink Machine because it has one sacrifice scene. Let me like my horror games. This Karen must have no life if they're willing to approach random people and inject themselves into their conversation like that. And I'll bet you a doughnut it was because she spotted your friend's little pride flag and wanted to bash them. What a freaking whack-job my image on some socials is the solar spectrum. Occasionally people make assumptions about that then get all confused... It's kinda hilarious. The real problem here is the FNaF lmao Christianity was a cult I would have told her to mind her business Yes FNaF is a cult Springtrap is the coolest FNaF animatronic 'Why are you gay?' If fnaf is a cult then I guess my family is in it. My 6 yo grandson is currently surrounded by 4 iterations of Bonnie plushies while watching it on YouTube. I ve learned to have fun with the Karen s who like to throw the cult word around Christianity, the biggest cult of them all! Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for death robots! Shoulda just threw your sandwich at her face My evangelical mother is concerned 'for my eternal soul' because I am pro-choice. When I come across Karen's I just say, 'excuse me sir' and compliment their moustache.. then walk away. How does a 40 year old not know this? The first game in the series isn't exactly new. no more appropriate time for a 'lol fuck off' Starbucks logo was accused of satanic connections as well. Nobody in Seattle cared. 90% of us are atheists anyway. r/brandnewsentence Read it as on subway and was confused why you had a samich until I read the beginning again 'I'm right' - Every Karen, ever. Their Fav nates at freduardo You do realise she didn t bring gender into the conversation she asked about your sexuality are you gay? not your gender Then all the Subway employees clapped Imagine being homophobic over the Willy's Wonderland game r/thathappened Next time just lean into it. It is a cult, but I assure you, it is not childish. The Dark Father does not take kindly to those that do not take his commands seriously. We meet on Wednesdays, would you like to come? One of our members has a mother fetish. She would ***love*** you! None of my business but I'm curious. He just carries around a flag? Like on a stick? Or it's a button or something? I'm trying to picture it. My daughter's purse is a pride flag ew subway As a FNAF fan myself, this is upsetting This is why I hate people. I remember growing up in the 80s in a Christian school and how EVERYTHING seemed to be Satanic lol. People still think DnD is satanic because it has players select gods for their character. The RNG gods are real tho, and they are merciless... Bruh my best friends mom claimed magic the gathering was devil worship cause it had the wor d magic Ffs There are still people that think The Harry Potter books are luring innocents to Satan When I was a senior in high school I had a friends father accuse me of that. We were playing The Wall by Pink Floyd backwards on a turntable to find the hidden message. We found it, but now I m a Satanist. So I grew up in the 90s. My favorite color was rainbow. I had a rainbow mini backpack and belt I wore pretty much daily to school. A girl I didn't know was a lesbian would always compliment me. It wasn't until much later a friend clued me in she was hitting on me and a lot of people thought I was gay. I had no idea. It had also been decided I must love girly things and pop music. I actually was very much a tomboy and listened to metal. No one thought the girl in rainbows was straight and into Mudvayne. You just can't stereo type people. Had a dude in high school get taken out of our DND campaign by his mom because she was sure it was about satanic worship Also, brown people who speak or write a language they don t recognize are all terrorists. Especially when they re on a plane. I have this thought often. The nerve of these people. You can tell they ve never been punched out. I d bet there s a clinical term for it. Its not really confidence though. Its blind hatred and a belief they're fighting some war. These people are sociopaths. 'a mental disorder in which a person consistently shows no regard for right and wrong and ignores the rights and feelings of others.' Yeah I have an idea what you mean. For example last night I was at Walmart and passing by some lady looking at the ramen noodle cups and I just randomly look over and say 'I think the cheddar cheese ones are pretty good.' I saw her slightly smile as I walked by, but I keep thinking now I hope she didn't get weirded out by it and that she understood I was just being nice with a casual suggestion because I saw her interacting with the noodles and looking what I thought was indecisive about flavors These people are good at picking their victims. She probably sized them up and figured that they would take the insults and/or walk away. The Bullies who pick the wrong people end up on r/publicfreakout. You re mistaking their delusions and ignorance for confidence I need a good, blanket response for people like this. Something that gives them a dressing down in 1 sentence or less. It's not so much confidence that they have IMO. It's an extremely low EQ which causes them to reach their breaking point very easily > I wouldn t be surprised if she s a member of a church that s actually kinda cultish all religions are a cult if it's not the majority Very much so, especially all the YouTube videos about it. My adult kids don't play it but they do watch people play on YouTube and sing the songs and stuff so it must be a cult /s incase anyone is wondering I mean, it has a cult like following among younger kids. Who excused some weird shit the creator was doing because they liked the games. Yes in deed.. a cult where you making up stories on Reddit to farm some karma Haven't played the games, so it took me a bit to figure out too. Five Nights at Freddy's >watching markiplier play She got part of it right 1. Probably a patch or a pin they have on their jacket or backpack. But it s also a possibility they carry an actual flag. Source: I go to art school. 2. FNaF is an abbreviation for Five Nights at Freddy s. It s a video game series where you play as a night guard at a pizzeria, and you have to defend yourself against those unsettling robots/animatronics you see at Chuck E. Cheese or ShowBiz Pizza. They want to kill you, hence death robots. The games have been going strong for almost 9 years now. You might even see movie trailers on TV for it in a few years. It s really popular with the younger crowd, which is why adults and parents get upset when they learn that their kids are becoming interested in the horror genre. We have an abbreviated version of the conversation . I wouldn t assume asserting gender was an error on the part of OP unless they said it was after clarification. What s that, a cult of some sort you childish gay people? Very much. Childish gay people lmfao. E: also what is FNaF? Blame social media & the news. The same reason I see lifted pickups with American flags on them. Showing support That's assault. Do you remember when Procter & Gamble products were all supposed to have a satanic symbol on the packaging somewhere because the company made a deal with Satan? The priest at my church made his sermon about that one Sunday and when we got home every kid went looking for it on anything we could find. In what I think was pretty rare for the Satanic panic days the priest did actually apologize for being wrong a few weeks later I remember my mom forcing me to watch Phil Donahue wherein the episode was all about how evil and bad rock and roll was. The first song they analyzed was Pour Some Sugar on Me and I about shit myself laughing. True enough, I was born in late 70's so I went through all that too And there I was, born in the 60's and being so disappointed that all those things in the 80's being called satanic actually weren't. I have a running theory that church is satanic If you play metal backwards it says hail Satan. It does that if you play it normal too I remember that movie Tom Hanks did in the 80s about how if you play this certain board game enough you turn into an insane murderer. 'Mazes and Monsters'. Debut movie for Tom. A satanic panic movie. In the 80s in my Christian 'school' I was told they taught beastiality in public school. Can confirm. Satanic and Backward Masking. On the flip side, I really appreciate the musical talents of the Eagles and Ozzy. Sadly, you are not alone... Everything except the priests fucking children. Everything except the priests fucking children. I'm sorry this happened to you and I hope you got out of that brainwash drivel that religion truly is Except the rampant molestation. It s only satanist if you spell it magick. Don t let her find out about certain cards. Demonic tutor, demonic ritual, demonic pact to name a few. Well, Tibalt is quite the trickster after all. Yeah when I read the first HP book I made the mistake of telling my mother that I was reading it. I was like 32 years old at the time so she had no say in what I could read but she kept going on and on about how the books were about devil worshiping and had secret hidden messages in them. It s useless to argue with her because she doesn t shut up if you do. I just roll my eyes and block out her nonsense Hey! has anyone read the books backwards or upside down, maybe there ARE secret hidden messages there I mean, JKR has shown herself to be evil... even if her intent didn't hit and she actually HELPED a bunch of trans people come out and she had to really explain her transphobic intent. Exactly, but ppl do As someone who didn't get an ADHD diagnosis until I was in my mid 20's, I sometimes wonder if a lot of them have untreated ADHD or are somewhere up the autism spectrum and just don't know it. Not that knowing would help, because I suspect that if a doctor told them at this stage of their lives and offered them treatment they'd just say 'Fuck you I'm too smart to have one of them r**ard diseases!!!' and then storm off. They probably want to be punched so they can do a lawsuit or fight back with 'reason'. Bunch of hot shots get in my face demanding me to punch them and I just laugh I mean, yeah, but this sounds off. I d guess this particular exchange didn t actually happen. I have random interactions with people in situations like this often, if it s a product I like a lot. Most people appreciate it. I've absolutely stopped and asked people who looked lost in grocery stores if they need help. I wonder how many have realized I didn't work there. I ended up helping one dude with his entire shopping list. Newly married, sent by his wife, and she had written everything down to the name brand and size for each item, but the store had almost none of them. It took us almost an hour of searching when she called to ask when he'd be back. He had to admit he even had help and couldn't find them. Turns out they were all Yoke's brands. He was at Safeway. I heard him say 'but you told me on the corner of these streets', and I dragged him outside by his arm and pointed across the street to the Yoke's. He hung up with her, thanked me, and then asked what the difference was. Yokes is more expensive but has way better produce. When I got home, my husband was like, 'you only had 5 things on your list. Did your ADHD kick in?' Maybe... 'You really think that's the case? Bless your heart!' 'Do I know you?' works more often than I thought it would. If they say 'no, but...' Just say 'oh', and ignore them. Oh, explains why I didn't know that, I'm not into anime. 1. Thanks, I have a son that has pins on his backpack, I never though of a flag pin, my brain was thinking an actual flag 2. I see says the blind man, my gaming is more simulation stuff. TIL. What an embarrassing, badly written story to make up and post Far fetched maybe but I ve heard people say dumber shit It's a game, 'Five Nights at Freddy's.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s Five Nights At Freddys - popular horror game. When the poster themselves doesn't know the difference between gender and sexuality, you know it's horseshit. Not to mention, your standard homophobe literally wouldn't recognize any other pride flag other than the rainbow flag. Nah. They ve always been that way. You re just noticing more because of social media and the news . When you have a 24 hour news cycle, you have to fill it with something, even if it s asinine shit. People is a pretty general term, I m not singling out any group other than homosapiens. Depending on which state you're in it might be *'battery'* Wasn't it their moon and stars or something Logo ? Man they were all paranoid back then haha Holy shit. The priest apologized? Did he get excommunicated for his act of personal responsibility? Yes they did a dollop about it and it was a crazy ass story! I m so thankful my parents didn t buy into all that stuff. Satan was never mentioned in our house, we had no reason to even think bad of any of it. Churches are the only ones who are satanic, because they are the only ones who believe in Satan. I don't remember it being taught, but a high school near me had two senior football players expelled for watching beastiality porn in the locker room, so... Maybe they weren't totally wrong about what you might be exposed to. LOL This was 1990, I think. Thanks it took a while but as I got older I started to think for myself and not believe everything they taught me in school Is that one of the older cards Started playing when it came out Wish I had kept some of those old cards smh Heroes always seem to let you down when you grow up and find out who they really are or they happen to start spouting crap when you re grown up , but man that one hit hard. Being disillusioned really sucks. I don't recognize Safeway or Yokes non US brands perhaps? , but wow that is pretty awesome of you to take so much time to help out others like that. I've helped out some people on rare occasions just through looking for same items or because being over 6' I can reach some of the extra stock items on top of shelves when the normal shelved items run out like at Walmart. Now I kind of wonder how many missed chances to save someone's day I've missed after reading your reply. If being helpful like that is from your adhd then good for you honestly, don't stop being helpful! And I hope that adhd comment comes across as nicely as I meant it to, I just know typed things can be read different than intended by different people. What does anime have to do with anything being discussed here? Agreed, I felt this belonged in r/thatHappened, but then I remembered the woman who ranted to me about SpongeBob being made for homosexuals. These kinds of people do exist. True. Edited. Spitting at someone is an assault. If the spit hits you, that s a battery. So yeah...maybe they miss, maybe they don't. Yes, that was it Back then? The moon was like a quarter moon old man face with a beard and the curls in his beard looked like 666 or something Priest only get excommunicated if they have sex with a consenting adult or are vocally pro choice. Omg! I knew there was something weird about those FFA students! Ritual and tutor are at least unlimited. Now imagine FNAF fans when they found out Scott paid for a part of them to be removed from the world. They're US stores, but Yokes seems to be only Pacific Northwest. I believe Safeway is Albertsons in other areas of the US. They own Haggen, as well. We used to also have Albertsons here, but they rebranded them all Safeway. Sort of. The Safeway I was talking about used to be an Albertsons, and the Yoke's across the street was a Safeway. They sold it to Yokes and rebranded the Albertsons about 4 years ago, confusing the hell out of everyone. At 5'6', I very much appreciate people like you who help get stuff off of the high shelves. So, thank you! I can figure it out myself, but not having to is always greatly appreciated. I don't take offense to your comment. I wish my ADHD always made me kind to people instead of sometimes leading me to blurt out pretty blunt things I never should have said. ADHD itself isn't the reason I tend to be helpful. That's just a personal trait. It 'is* the reason I can get very fixated on a task. It's definitely the reason I have no sense of time passing. I honestly had no idea I'd been helping him for so long until she called. It hadn't even occurred to me to grab my own things as we looked. I do think ADHD is the reason I don't think about whether offering to help might be socially awkward or not. I'm not even going to think about it; I'm just going to see if I can help. I'm not thinking about being kind, either. It's just in my nature to help if I can. So, yeah, ADHD doesn't make me kind, but it makes it more apparent that I am. My impulsiveness leads to stuff like, 'Just met you people at a conference, and now you're inviting me to walk 5 miles with you to go drink on a wooden tugboat? Sure! Let's go! I'll buy the alcohol on the way.' I got a full tour of this amazing old boat and got to hang out on the roof and watch the stars in great company that night when I had been really bored and alone in that city. I once saw a really old guy hitchhiking along a rural highway and picked him up. Turned out he was trying to get home about 40 miles out of my way. I took him. As a thanks, he gave me a beautiful bracelet and wouldn't let me say no. A few weeks later, I had a driver swerve off the road and smash up my bicycle that had been leaning against a tree while I went pee in the woods and drive off. The guy who stopped to help after I'd walked a few miles carrying that bike recognized the bracelet and didn't just take me to the next town a few miles more where he lived, he drove me 60 miles home and bought me lunch on the way. The old guy apparently makes the jewelry and only gives it to people special to him or that help him without asking for anything in return. Two days later, I came home from work to a bike almost exactly like mine on my porch with a bow on it and a note, 'Thanks for getting Tom home safely. He's not completely himself anymore, and he'd been missing for 3 days. We heard what happened and wanted to help you out, too.' Man, all I did was give him a lift. I sat on my porch and cried a little thinking about that old man wandering out there in the middle of nowhere for that long and no one picking him up until I did, and then I went for a bike ride. : Yeah, I've still got the note. Some of my best stories and memories come from not thinking first. ADHD can really be terrible sometimes, but it can also be a life of adventure if you let it. And being a generally nice and helpful person can not only help me be in a better mood, more than once in my life, it's paid off though that's not what I was expecting or why I did it. It just feels wrong to see someone needs help, know I can help, and do nothing. I have to live with myself. Even a seemingly tiny thing can save someone's day, seriously. I remember the night I was in New Orleans and my mom called to say my grandfather had passed away. All flights were booked. I couldn't go home. I sat down on a park bench and just looked as sad as I was. Some random woman came up, sat down next to me, and said, 'You can have my shoulder if you want it.' I leaned my head on it, and she put her arm around me and just let me be there for about 5 minutes without either of us saying a word. That meant so much to me right then, and it only cost her 5 minutes of her life. It's been years, and I'll never forget her. That shoulder kept me going through the 4 days until I could get home, the huge windstorm that knocked out power for the whole city for a week due to hundreds of downed trees, hours and hours spent on a volunteer chain saw crew to keep from being lonely because my husband worked long hours for the power company that week, and dealing with my shitty family when we could finally have a funeral. Those days weren't honestly the worst of my life, but they do rank pretty high, and a random stranger was there for me when I needed it. I hope to be that random stranger as much as I can, too. This world has far too many crappy people, and I refuse to be one of them. Also, you noticing me because I did something kind kept me writing this the whole time the Tylenol kicked in and brought my fever down, distracting me from how miserable I was. I can now go sleep. So, thanks for that, too. : Have mercy on me, I'm an old fart that knows nothing about the FNaF. Insane how they used to think about things. Video games, D&D, products, songs...surprised I am so well rounded now haha Also fair lol 1, that s not entirely true, I remember a priest being defrocked and excommunicated for being too vocal about the need to discuss the growing AIDS epidemic in the 80s, for example. And 2, how many o s are there in r/wooosh, exactly? I'm from the Midwest and don't visit many places beyond Walmart, CNR, some gas stations, and a few other occasional other places in a nearby bigger city, but it's neat to hear about other places out there too. Sometimes I feel like I'm too tall but reaching higher shelves can be useful so it works out. The random kindness of strangers can have surprising results as you pointed out of helping the old man and then someone helped you out so much because of that, and the time the lady gave you her shoulder, it's nice to be nice. Also hope you feel better from what's got you down and have a good sleep! I'm 40 myself, I was just curious why anime was brought up out of the blue is all, haha! Blues music, rock 'n' roll, Halloween, comic books. . . . they're still paranoid CRT, blm, antifa, trans people, Disney, etc etc Lol, used to? I guess because I'm an idiot... How did we all survive? Haha That Satan guy sounds like an awesome dude. He s got great music, fun festivals and comics? Sign me up! Wait til fundamentalists learn about witches. Could lead to burnings and whatnot. Everyone promise to be very quiet least we rouse the crazies even further! Yep. They just shifted the goalposts I mean technically there was 2 fake animes in one of the games. So you're half correct. lol is all good! *Tbf have any of us felt alive since 2019?* ^/s By eating plenty of babies and playing records backwards. By the power of God S Hey wait, wouldn't two animes be double correct!? ;- Okay that is fair lol *2016 *2012 By the power of Ra! Not if you stack it against all the canonical games without an anime. Trust me, 50% was generous. removed Damn you, you damn Mayans By the power of Grayskull! I'm almost 60, my last anime was Warner Bros Looney Tunes. Also, a bunch of celebrities... such as Harambe You have the power!",

		"body": "So this was basically one of these incidents that could have been avoided by not taking my dog to the city centre. Basically, my family and i bought a beautiful, loving flat coated retriever back in 2021. Hes trained by me im not the alpha and my dad. Very well. We actually care about raising our dog to a great standard of obedience, which can be difficult with this particular breed as its considered an exuberant and confident breed. To mention, this is not our first dog, so we kinda know what we do and we keep in contact with dog trainers to progress and adapt to new behaviour. This dog, his name is Frodo, is very friendly and has a particular close bond with me, my girlfriend and my father. This means, he gets sad as soon as one mentioned leaves, but doesnt stay in this mindset for long as others are around there is at least one person at home pretty much always . Last month my girlfriend and i went to the city centre, to buy wrapping paper and other things. Just a small tour, nothing big, because i didnt want to stress out my puppy as it was this time of the year where a lot of people were going out shopping and the city centre was crowded.It was raining. I waited for my girlfriend in front of a shop while she got some stuff with my dog on sit command he behaved great and is always on a leash with a harness or collar and gave him a treat. After some time he got a bit irritated and started squeaking a bit as my girlfriend didnt come back. KAREN. I look at my phone, distracted once, and this woman in her late 60s early 70s approaches me. K:'Why are you letting your dog sit in a puddle? In the rain? isn't he cold?' Me in a polite german way : ' don't worry, mam, he won't be cold, hes fine.' *looks back at phone, Frodo LAYS DOWN on his own in the puddle and misses my girlfriend* K: 'look at me when i talk to you. You young people don't know shit about how to behave, nor do you have the experience/guts i don't remember exactly what she said to actually train animals. This is disgusting. DON'T YOU HEAR HIM SQUEAK?!?!?!' She comes closer, tries to grab my phone and attention as i clearly did not want to discuss with her how to take care of my dog . I dodge her hands, she tries to go for the leash, i dodge her hands again. By that time, theres like 2million people staring at us. I didn't say a word , as i was irritated by that, this shit never ever happened to me before. I look at her, focus and tell her Me:' do you even know what breed that is? He would be in agony if i got him out of the water. Please step away from me.' I was as polite as much as i could. But that 'sarcasm' needed to be, as he enjoyed both puddles,lakes,oceans and the warmth of a lit fireplace. She steps away, grabs her phone, calls the police on me. Comes towards me and my dog. By that time my girlfriend came out of the store, not realizing what the fuck was going on, smiling at me saying something like 'lets go i need to grab something else'. My dog lays happy in the puddle and waves his tail as he stands up to great my girlfriend. My girlfriend looks at me and KKKaren and asks Girlfriend:'Is there a problem, mam?' K:' ARE YOU SERIOUS? THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. IN BROAD DAYLIGHT THIS GUY, CLEARLY AN ANIMAL ABUSER HAS HIS DOG ON A SHORT LEASH AND FORCES HIM IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY TO LAY DOWN IN THIS DIRTY MUDDY WATER' *turns around to adress the mass of people* ' HELP ME , SOMEONE HELP THIS POOR DOG' After minutes of this tirade the police arrived and questioned the lady and then me. I explained what had happened. The policeman asks me if i want to press charges against her as she actually tried to touch me. I tell him no. Policeman turns around and lectures KKKaren about behaviour in public and how to not waste the police's time. KKKaren, if you read this because your children or grandchildren introduce you to r/FuckYouKaren , I wanna say fuck you for calling me an animal abuser. I love my dog. I wish you great healing from all the knee/hip joint pain you must have from carrying so much negativity. Edit: did some text clean up. I hope my german english is understandable.",

I tell him no. Karen's don't change unless they face a consequence, always press charges when given the option. Your 'German English' is a lot better than the English of a lot of people born and raised in the US. Haha Typisch Deutsch deine Reaktion ich liebe es Karens are delusional enough to believe they're experts on everything. Some learn from serious consequences. Others never learn. Dogs in general LOVE muddy puddles. When my yorkie was a puppy, he stupidly laid down in an icy puddle. Of course we quickly pulled him out and dried him off. If he was a husky, we would have let him enjoy it. You may have seen people spell 'KKKaren' and not realized the implication. In the US, there is a white-nationalist hate group called the Klu Klux Klan - often called the 'KKK.' A lot of Karens are racist, so get dubbed KKKaren. Don t worry. Your puppy is safe with you. Thats all that really matters. removed Sorry, why would the police ask if you wanted to press charges for her trying to touch you? Where is that a crime, unless she tried to hit you? Touching could be depending on circumstances, but attempted touching? Do you mind sending your dog pics I had two Flat Coats growing up and I completely understand the need for mama AND the absolute desire for water this breed had. I was nearly dragged into my parents pond by one of them when they saw it for the first time. They are as agreeable and exuberant as Goldens with the abilities of a seal. Plus, they almost never get wet to the skin because of their coats. You were absolutely right to have yours on a short leash and a puddle to flop in. A side note: FCRs are prone to spleen cancer. Please ask your vet about regular screening. It eventually took both of mine. What's with the 3 K's to start? Being polite and entertaining Karens and their assaults as you just described only serves to enable and embolden them for next time. Do not do this. Be as hostile and insulting as possible - particularly about their appearance and how they smell. Wither them with loud invective. This is how you deal with these entitled fascist slobs. Your English is just perfect People like that make me insane. I see animal abuse all too often, and this ain't it. Karen can suck it. Had basically the same conversation half a bajillion times cause one of my dogs is HIGLY reactive! She comes from a backyard breeder who would beat her, so she s always tethered to me outside, even for potty breaks, because she is so reactive. People freak out when I don t let her run around in my backyard, but its for her own safety. If she bites someone cause she totally can jump my four foot fence! she will be put down. She doesn t like being pet, she doesn t play ball, she doesn t like squeaky toys, ect. I m not abusing her, she s been abused, but I m not abusing her! She does adore blankets, rolls herself up in them like a puppy burrito not pressing charges...guarantee she will do it again. Yikes! So sorry you had to deal with such an ignorant, awful person. I know this breed, very friendly and adores his owners, loves to work and train with the owners and also loves to swim and fetch dummies etc out of the water. Reading your story I have to say I felt sorry for you that you have to experience an Karen encounter. You obviously know how to handle this puppy. I hope you can laugh about it when you tell this story to your friends and family. And of course enjoy every moment with your dog I know ALL about dogs who need their mama. I have a chihuahua and a chihuahua/terrier mix. They are never more than 3 feet from me, and when I do have to leave them in the car to pump gas, or at home when I go for errands.. they whimper!! No my dogs are not in distress. They are just REALLY needy. Why didn t you just tell her fuck you for calling you an animal abuser to her face when you had the chance ? There's no such thing as an alpha when it comes to dogs. That shit was disproven decades ago. Typical asozial behaviour, wow. When the girlfriend showed up, they should have just left Karen standing there. Why stick around for the bullshit? Its a bit comical in a way: Flat coated retriever meets a Schnauzer or ankle biter. Two Names in German that predate Karin by many decades. The Karin species are often seen on the trams in Z ri. I would say the Karls are slightly more predominate than the Karins to be honest. I suspect your not in Switzerland. There is a strong ethic to work things out yourself, you know the behaviors most learn in Kintergarden. Kindergarten a german idea itself is based on learning to get along with others, the foundation required before more andvanced learning and symbol manipulation. Up until recently many Cantons required two years of Kindergarten, for getting along, social cohesion considered is very important. Why is it that all Karens think people owe them answers or conversation?!? Does polite German not sound angry lol? It all sounds angry to me! Being polite and entertaining Karens and their assaults as you just described only serves to enable and embolden them for next time. Do not do this. Be as hostile and insulting as possible - particularly about their appearance and how they smell. Wither them with loud invective. This is how you deal with these entitled fascist slobs. This sub needs to learn TLDR Your German English is fine. Better than most people here who attempt to speak English. Being polite and entertaining Karens and their assaults as you just described only serves to enable and embolden them for next time. Do not do this. Be as hostile and insulting as possible - particularly about their appearance and how they smell. Wither them with loud invective. This is how you deal with these entitled fascist slobs. Obvious fake story is obvious Dude you need to man up. I mean yeah you must be right, but if you look at it like this : in Germany there is something called Altersarmut, which kinda translates into elderly people being poor because of certain circumstances in society , as it changes. This Altersarmut is a serious issue. She didnt look like she was poor, but there was no way i was going to take the chance and press charges against someone who will be held accountable for such things when this person will not and probably never again after this be able to pay for anything. I have no intentions of ruining someones life, like she tries to on a daily basis assumption Yeah but pressing charges also means you have to deal with going to the police station to file paperwork, deal with further correspondence, show up at court if the woman fights the charge, possibly have to retain a lawyer, worry about a countersuit even if frivolous, etc, etc. Basically it's a fucking nightmare and grandma trying to touch you is not worth it. All she did was yell at him and attempt to touch him, no need to ruin her life over it that s overkill, even if she did manage to touch him still overkill, only press charges if the situation caused lasting physical or mental damage Bruv no for reals though. I swear to god I had an English professor who typed emails worse than this. Wait, is OP an English professor? Manchmal brauchts in dieser kranken Welt ein wenig Sarkasmus HCD Happy cake day Happy cake day! Why does everyone always want people to press charges over the smallest things like this? She literally did nothing to him other than yell and attempt to touch him, pressing charges for that is completely unnecessary and you re just going to make an enemy for no reason Attempting to touch someone is considered assault because they didn t consent to being touched, if she actually did touch him it would be battery You aren't allowed to try and snatch someone's stuff away front hem. You failing to do so doesn't mean it still not a crime. I tried posting this including pictures, but it wasnt possible... Asking the right questions here! I will post a new post now Most retriever breeds are only truly happy when semi-aquatic. I used to dogsit one that would gleefully submarine repeatedly through a drainage ditch filled with partly frozen muddy water, leaving a bow wave like a monster shark about to surface. Walking that dog was always a two-part process, with the second part being a bath. Just my rant about this woman, i thought it might correlate when i assume her political view So stoop to their level instead of being the bigger person and not letting them bother you because they barely did anything other than waste time, that s totally what people should be doing, not at all trying to just move on with their life and not let minor things like this bother them when nothing came of it Good question. I think i might be a bit too friendly or too introverted. Thank you for making me look it up! This is some great piece of info. Nah m8 im not in switzerland. Im in north rhine westphalia, ruhr area to be precise. I read the book 'der kleine knigge' a long time ago... that was compulsory for me and my sister back in the days Thats what we consider prejudice If a story is too long, don t read it, no one is going to care if you complain about how long a story is when you can easily just choose to ignore it and find a shorter one to read. People who announce their complaints to the entire world when they can easily fix the issues on their own are some of the most annoying people in existence I mean you choose to read it or you dont... its free content at the end right? Opinion rejected Holding someone accountable for their actions isn't 'ruining their life'. You're helping her, and helping society. By refusing to help her realize her actions are unacceptable, other people are now going to be her victims. I had two Flat Coats growing up. Does yours talk to you? One of mine was always making weird noises. He was such a goof. Also would lay in puddles. They are water dogs so it's not that surprising. Also you need to be careful with them. Hip dysplasia is really common. It can be seen on X-Rays early on. You can have your vet look if you haven't already. You need to change the dogs activities if they're prone to it. She wasn't shoplifting food, she was attacking you because she's an asshole. This is not a finance issue. Cheers to you OP for keeping your cool! You know what was right and stood by it. Good on ya as some places say in the states ! Yo bin aus DE. Ja das ist aber keine Entschuldigung daf r dass sie mit dem Verhalten durchkommt. Wenn sich zu arm bin um potentielle Strafen zu zahlen, berleg ich mir vorher was ich mache. Sie hat dich angegangen. Ihre Aktion. Die Anzeige w re nur deine normale Reaktion gewesen If doing the right thing was easy, everyone would be doing it. Karens rely on people deciding it's not worth their time of dealing with it, and only get worse the more times that's proven to be true. 1 The person chose to receive those consequences when they chose to do the action. If anything, they chose to ruin their own life. But, lets be real here, a minor assault charge is barely a slap on the wrist, not ruining anyone's life by any stretch of the imagination . 2 It's not about how much damage you receive, it's about protecting others from receiving the same harassment/assault/inconvenience. 'This is America! Speak English!' A joke. You can dm them, i dont mind xd DM THE DOGGO!! I ll respond with my own doggo if you want! 100%. One of my dogs was a pretty, pretty princess until she found a drain and then she turned into a stinking, slimy, mud demon. Your method of rationalizing cowardly inaction as the cool and evolved response? A proven failure. Karens and their disgusting ilk are more emboldened than ever before. But you already know that, that s why you re so peevish. Keep hiding behind your porcelain adages though, whatever It is, my bad. This is an interesting conversation, imo you are both right: if no one holds her accountable she might never learn and eventually create more problems to more people. At the same time by being compassionate you don't overflow the system with another silly procedure and a cop chastizing her might be enough for her to learn the lesson without creating additional more drama. It's just two different ways to look at society and the importance of payback/teaching when someone did something wrong to us. I wonder how much of that is cultural USA or German attitude and how much it is about just different people with different social backgrounds. Personally I would let it go too, just because I would not want to invest additional time or energy in a not issue and with the cop offering I would already feel satisfied. But I get who would love to crush her for being an ass. This could have been a life long behaviour of hers that has been reprimanded over and over without any outcome or consequences. She hasn t learned and at her age probably never will. Although this time her antics might have cost her financial stability if she had been arrested and fined. He always talks to me. And to church bells. And to threats in the dark. Yeah he is prone to bone issues, he has a slightly crooked tail since birth... OP is saying that in pressing charges, she would have to pay for a lawyer, likely pay fines, etc, and he does not want to subject her to that on the off chance that she might already be struggling financially because it s a huge issue in Germany. There s a much better way to prevent stuff like this happening to someone else without causing a possibility financially unstable person to lose every last dime they have for a stupid mistake they can easily learn from for free Amerikanische u mean . SPRICH DEUTSCH DU HURENSOHN FCR FTW! And you keep trying to throw around big words to sound smart while stooping to the dumbass levels of Karens instead of beating them the proper way by not acting like they do, see how well that works for you WW1 and 2 made me that way. All gucci, just remember that german population changed a lot. Like 100 times a lot. I would press charges, but ask if she repays her behavior as mandatory volunteer work at an animal shelter. That way it costs her only time, she learns a lesson, and learns about animals and behaviors. I worked in a kennel for 7 years and you learn a lot. IMO, if it's a non-issue, the cops wouldn't be involved in the first place, let alone asking if you want to file charges. If her action is worthy of police intervention and the filing of charges, clearly an issue exists, and refusing to allow that issue to impact the perpetrator only serves to confirm to them that what they've done is acceptable. That 'old dogs can't learn new tricks' bullshit is just a wives tail. Old people can learn lessons just as easily as the rest of us, especially when they're taught the hard way. The funny noises are the best. I wish I had video of my dog doing that. Op may be a better person than I am. Well, don't leave us hanging, what's your superior solution then? No. Or yes. I don't know. I m just playing around. Germanys nothing like it was in the 1900 s. I like the way you think. Pressing charges takes anything after out of your hands. Well, they were involved because she called them and actually they chastized her for wasting their time. For what I know the cops will automatically arrest her if there was damage or a clear crime, but in a case like this each person evaluates if it makes sense to them to press charges according to their own rational ethic an interests. My point is, even if I understand where you are coming from it makes sense to me to choose differently and not follow through, I think OP had no obligation at all to waste more time or try to teach her a lesson of sort. Different opinions mate. You have to have experience working with senior citizens before you can say what they are or aren t capable of. Until then your talking shit out of your ass. I shouldn t have to explain it, getting someone in monetary trouble just simply because they made an attempt to touch you and not even hurt you should be common sense that that s unnecessary and overkill, you don t solve anything by causing them to spend every dime to their name over something this minor, you teach them a lesson by having the police give them a verbal warning, if that doesn t work THEN you should step it up, don t go full out first thing Teaching seniors is literally part of my job, I assure you, they really are capable of learning and changing. Old people are lazier and more stubborn, but not dumber. I can't tell if this is a long winded joke, or if you actually believe a verbal warning would do anything. It has nothing to do with being dumb, it has to do with the fact that old people almost always have more mental problems or illnesses to contend with so it makes everything more difficult including learning. You want to know why you think verbal warning s don t work? It s probably because people like you would much rather take the easy road and give them the worst possible punishment for a small minor inconvenience instead of talking to them first and trying to figure out why they acted that way at that moment. Verbal warnings will work if you had the patience to try them in the first place but it seems like you would much rather just sue everyone for every dime they have over absolutely nothing Pressing criminal charges has nothing to do with a civil suit, there's no money changing hands, you're not going after their money. You're seeking a punishment, a repercussion for their actions. One of the first things kids learn is that being yelled at means you avoided actual punishment, 'didn't even get punished, they just yelled at me' is something every kid has said at some point. Nothing changes when you become an adult, a verbal warning means you got away with it, it's the opposite of a consequence. If a cop gives you a warning and says if they catch you doing x again you ll face jail or whatever it usually is enough to get people to stop doing it, you pestering the police after that because you don t believe it will stop them is just stupid, especially if while pestering them the police tell you what will happen if they get caught doing it again that should be the point where you realize you don t need to do anything else and just drop it. If your parents tell you to stop doing something the only thing they can punish you with is taking something away or sending you to your room which will eventually get reversed and it won t go on a physical record like going to jail would A verbal warning from a cop is not the same as getting yelled at by your parents or a teacher when you re little, your parents don t have any power to actually punish you physically without facing legal repercussions for physical abuse, the police have the power to put you in jail after one warning which is a far worse punishment than getting yelled at or grounded >A verbal warning from a cop is not the same as getting yelled at by your parents or a teacher when you re little It really is the same. A warning is a warning, no matter who employs them. >the police have the power to put you in jail after one warning which is a far worse punishment than getting yelled at or grounded The police also have the power to put you in jail with no warning, which is far more effective than a warning, as evidenced by the fact that tons of people in jail have received a warning prior to their arrest for the same damn thing. I m done, I can t sit here and argue with someone who s too fucking stubborn to understand why it s unnecessary to press charges or do anything related to that to a person who literally did nothing to them but attempt to touch them and yell at them a little bit, especially since that person could possibly be very poor and doesn t deserve having to use every fucking dime they posses to get a lawyer to defend themselves all because the person who s getting them in trouble is petty and would rather teach them a harsh lesson over a minor incident instead of letting them learn on their own like everyone is capable of doing Thinking that someone going around yelling at people is going to stop yelling because you yell at them, is as ridiculous as thinking you can stop someone looking for a fight by fighting them. Warnings are the opposite of a repercussion, it *never* changes behavior. I mean, look at you, yelling and getting all upset. Changes nothing for me. I m not even getting upset, you interpret my text that way, but you can t read emotions through text it doesn t work that way",

		"body": "On a warmish day in Seattle last Spring my friend met me for lunch and brought her dog, which she adores more than all humans. Seriously, she pampers that pup. This was a cafe with big roll-up doors. It was maybe 70 degrees out and the sidewalk was in shade. My friend tied her pooch to a post and we walked ten feet to the door, and were seated right away at a table about five feet from where the dog was. The roll up doors were open. We were almost petting distance from the dog. In the 15 seconds it took us for the host to seat us, a Seattle Karen had already swooped in to 'rescue' this 'abandoned' pooch. 'DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO'S DOG THIS IS? IS THIS YOUR DOG??' Yup, my friend calmly replied. 'IT'S NOT SAFE TO LEAVE HIM TIED UP LIKE THAT!' Ok, we are right here. Got it. 'HE SEEMS THIRSTY! HAS HE HAD WATER?? SHOULD I GET HIM SOME WATER? IT'S HOT OUT HERE ON THE SIDEWALK!!' Sure, he just had some water, but knock yourself out. Karen goes to the host stand, barges past everyone waiting and asks the host who is now on the phone if they can provide her a bowl of water. The host shakes his head. We have a good chuckle about it and carry on. The dog is calm. Sitting. Looking at us. Being a good boy. Minutes later, Karen has dragged a construction worker over for backup. The construction worker pulls out his utility blade and cuts the top off his water bottle so that the dog can drink out of it!! Um, thanks, we say. 'IT'S TOO HOT TO LEAVE YOUR DOG TIED UP OUTSIDE! IT'S NOT SAFE!! LOOK, HE'S PANTING!' They put the water in front of him and he doesn't even glance down. He's just enjoying all of the attention. We thank her again for her concern and go back to our conversation. Just sucked all the oxygen right out of her fire. She had to go find someone else to rile up, I'm sure. We had lunch to enjoy.",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* Please attach the dog to your chair in the future. Because these Karen's WILL try and walk off with peoples dogs no matter what they are told. And if 70 is too hot for a dog I'm not sure what she is on. My two will happily lay out in that weather for ages to soak up the rays. I m confused. If this is a pet friendly place, why couldn t you and friend be placed outside with the dog. I would NEVER take my dog somewhere where I would have to tie her up away from me. Not saying Karen wasn t wrong, but ffs, if you re taking your dog, make sure it s a dog friendly place where your dog can be next to you. 1 thank you for not bringing your dog into the eating area. This is against the law in Washington. Same goes for grocery stores. You might not think it's not a big deal until you step in dog shit in aisle 9. 2 seattle has one of the highest Karen rates per capita, anecdotally speaking 3 thank you for patronizing local restaurants, it's important 4 next time just compliment Karen on her moustache,, that may truncate the conflict hot outside. lady sees dog. lady gets dog water. lady is karen. These stories seem to be getting stupider. People always have opinions about animals and children. You were nicer than I might have been. Also, your tag is misleading. I thought you had tamed one. maybe just leave your 'emotional support puppy' at home next time This sounds familiar. Christ, even if it s 90 degrees outside my black lab will lay outside in the direct sunlight It would be hard to tie the dog to a chair before you know where you will be sitting. We have restaurants in town where you have to see the hostess INSIDE to get a table OUTSIDE, and dogs are not allowed inside. One person should have stayed with the dog while the other went in to see about seating. Then Karen wouldn t have anything to gripe about. 70 is blazingly hot for Seattle. At least it used to be, but not so much anymore. Mine lays out in 105f all the time. For quite a while. I usually have to force her inside My friend's dog was slightly more than arm's length away with no wall or barrier between us. Like if you opened your patio door and tied your dog outside but were sitting inside. And in Seattle when it is sunny and 70, we all start worrying about heat stroke. Huh, in Rome dogs go EVERYWHERE. Some grocery stores have special carts for the dogs. People have strollers for their dogs and there are LOTS of dogs A. It was not hot B lady was yelling, overreacting, barged into restaurant, dragged stranger into situation. Instead of , you know, calmly asking who owns dog, seeing owner is 5 feet away then moving on as there was no issue. Welllll, more like lady was acting like it was an emergency after 15 seconds, and treating us as though it was animal cruelty when the dog wasn't even panting or thirsty, but I hear you. Luckily I don't have many Karen stories to share. My friend was on her way back from a road trip with her dog and wanted to stop and have lunch with me and didn't want to leave her dog in the car. > Then Karen wouldn t have anything to gripe about. Karens will ALWAYS find something to gripe about I've called places while being out the front asking for seating for me n my doggies. But this works if you have two people. I dont trust anyone stranger near my dogs these days.. I'm in vegas so 70 is like spring or fall weather. Italians also peel the skin off their fruit and vegetables...",

Only thing more annoying than the woman yelling at the fisherman is the goddamn talking heads at tyt. Ha, I understood some of the that..mostly. The young turks are insufferable. A bunch of self righteous twats with a very problematic name foe their org. One thing that confuses me is what is a 'fisherwoman' never herd that term before That was insane. Actually - in the UK we d just call them Anglers The accent and screaming annoyed me. He goes on to say he's going to take advantage of the fact that he can still get away with making fun of british accents their cockney one here until the window of opportunity closes, which for someone like me who can't hear the difference is extra funny especially when he appareny started using the cockney accent. Hmm, quite the sheltered mysognistic life you've had. I don't know any, but I've often heard and seen the term. And it's pretty self explanatory. 'Hurrrr hurrrr I've heard of a fisherman, but I'm pretty fucking dumb and can't for the life of me figure out what a fisherwoman is.' I m sure there s lots of things that confuse poor Mikey.

Since then somehow she lucked out and got anger management classes and 50 hours community service. Sounds kinda light, but she has to clean up litter on the local beach and ATM the weather here is FOUL, it's cold near constant rain, and for last few days, winds gusting to 35mph. I guess tho they won't have them out in that weather. Dunno tho if honest Just hope she learns from this. My friends father that works at the supermarket, was there to give evidence and said she did the whole crying and saying she was sorry and it was out of character for her yada yada.

The only part out of character it seems is her getting held accountable. Glad it ended up getting sorted and working out OP please tell me she's banned from the store at least Why would some rain and wind stop community service? That s not that powerful of wind and she can obviously wear a rain jacket for the rain, where I live a normal windy day is much worse than 35mph and no one stays home unless they are old or physically fragile I m so glad she got her comeuppance! Next time someone does that shit to me, Im going to escalate it. It is a form of assault and harassment when you get down to it. These ableist fucks need to learn the hard way apparently. I'm glad you pressed charges. So many Karens get off lightly. This whole story reeks of Southern California entitlement garbage person. The Covid control conspiracy part reminds me of the people of my home town San Clemente actively protesting against masks and social distancing in the thick of 2020. Couldn't be more ashamed of them. I'm sorry someone tried to put their hands on you, that's inexcusable. I love when justice is served, congrats dude. One win for the little guy for once :- I didn't see the original story, but I'm so glad to see the update and read the original now. Good for you! I deal with that kind of bullshit all the time. My mom is disabled. We haven't bothered with a disabled plate because she can't drive. So I pull up to the door, let her out, and then go park the car and join her. When it's time to leave, she waits by the door while I go get the car and bring it round. So far, I haven't gotten into a full blown altercation, but I've had a couple of people approach me and start to yell when I pull up in the loading zone, stop the car, and get out. They shut up real fast when they see Mom approaching with her walker and her oxygen. That's some bit of amusement, but, really. Why on earth did they *think* I pulled up to the loading zone in front of the physical therapy clinic? People have gone nuts, I swear. Glad this one saw some consequences. People like her never learn. You know that old saying 'You can't fix stupid.'? It was created to describe idiots like her. She will be back to her antics in no time. Granted probably a delay in posting your original as well...but holy shit sentenced within a week?! How did this get to court in basically a week? I am glad she was punished but that is very fast. Does anyone actually believe that all of this happened in less than a week??? Such bullshit It's nice to see a Karen get their comeuppance. She was a rotten piece of work. Good for you and all the best my dear. From Scotland! Well it ain't jail but should be enough to teach her to mind her own business and not harass people with disabilities.. If she didn't have any previous record it might explain why she got off so lightly, which sucks but at least it's hopefully a learning experience for her. Thank you for your service in reporting and persecuting her. I'm so sorry this all happened let that be a warning to Karens If she has a record of this behaviour then she won't be able to pull the 'out of character ' nonsense in court without someone calling her on her BS. Me too. I'm pretty sure from all the vids out there it's a Karen gambit anytime they end up in trouble Banned from every Tesco's in Yorkshire I'm told Human rights act I guess? Like I said I'm no expert. Personally I hope she's out there right now in it. It s NoT sAfE tO pIcK uP LiTtEr wHiLe WeT. My guess would be if the service to be performed is trash pickup and removal it is hard to do with high winds. We don't get the choice to press charges or not. Yhe police get told what happens they investigate, and if there is enough evidence, it goes to the Crown Prosecution Service. The original post was 6 days ago. The justice system does not work that fast Well stupid ppl and Karens are in most countries these days lol OC is full of these folks. It's because she's the victim in this case! /s Local county court and she pleaded guilty. Guess local courts are quiet ATM. Tbh tho most local crimes rou d here tend to be sppedi g tickets etc. Anything assault wise that had resulted in an injury would have been kicked up a level and taken longer It didn't. There's no way in hell that someone was arrested tried and convicted in less than a week. OP is full of shit I don t understand why other people are so offended and butt hurt when strangers are wearing a mask. What is it harming? How does it personally affect that person, and why do they even GAF if you want to mask up? Seriously, I don t wear a mask most of the time, but if a place requires it, meh, whatever. On it goes. If someone is in their empty car driving down the road with one on, I chuckle to myself but I don t get enraged. If I see one in a grocery store, I assume they are sick, or immunocompromised and I maintain a healthy space or choose a different aisle out of respect for whatever their reasoning is. My altering my path is literally the only thing that changes for me, and I do it out of courtesy.it doesn t ruin my day. It doesn t affect my mood. It has no impact on the weather, the road conditions, or if I ve got enough money to buy what I m there for. I really hate most people nowadays-those with their virtue signaling and those with their irrational anger towards any variation to normalcy. As many have said, clown world. It s the standard response really I love Yorkshire but that coastline this time of year will be a terrible place to be, she deserves it though. The human rights act isn t going to prevent you from doing community service unless the weather is so bad that it s causing destruction and injury or death is likely Find out where she s doing it. Bring a bag popcorn People come up with excuses to get out of almost everything nowadays, it s exhausting She committed a crime, if she has to pick up trash she should have to do it regardless of the weather unless it s a tornado or hurricane or something that could risk death. If you refuse to go outside just because of some wind or rain I will literally never understand that, weather shouldn t stop people from doing things unless it s literally unsafe for those things to bs done because of it Just because it s hard doesn t mean she should be given the chance to get out of doing it, it s supposed to be a punishment, some wind making it more difficult should be giving them more incentive to make her go do it Interesting. I wish we had that here for certain things. OP is in England I believe, so maybe things like this move quickly there? She will always consider herself the victim, that's what makes it pathetic. I am just surprised that it went that fast, but glad she got hers. People who need the disabled badges don t need Karens to ruin their shopping on top of everything else. >If someone is in their empty car driving down the road with one on, I chuckle to myself but I don t get enraged. I had someone say they did that because they worked for DD. Since they had other people's food in their car, they wore their mask. On the days in December when the high temp got all the way up to 8 degrees F in my Texas town, I wore a mask while driving because it prevented my asthma from flaring up. I never knew before Covid that keeping my air intake warm would help keep my asthma attacks at bay. Otherwise, I don't normally wear one in the car, but as you say, I don't get enraged if someone else does. Ah ok good to know She might. OP said they had no idea Yeah not at all. Its just a masturbation fantasy post. I get the blue badge shit alot, her mask attitude surprised me more, hell every time I go for dialysis, I have to wear a mask unless eating. If I go in hospital I have to wear a mask whenever someone comes to me or I leavey bed. I hate the masks but I have had COVID-19 once despite multiple vaccine boosters. The uncomfortable period of time I can deal with. But the food is in an insulated bag. I DD, and don t wear a mask generally. Plus, have you seen some of those cars? Some will deliver food with their DOG in the car! Some will carry a pizza sideways too, but they are special. I don t wear a mask unless it s requested at the drop off. Plus I keep my car relatively clean so I CAN door dash. Interesting, cold air and asthma flare up correlated. TIL, Ty. My BIL got arrested for shoplifting. Brought to police station, arrested, bail. 4 days later has initial hearing, told to pay back store, 20 hours community service. This was in Boston. Hey I'm just saying that's what one particular driver did. It makes sense, reasonable reason.",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* Karen is mad because she wanted to complain about someone with a full cart and you ruined her fantasy. Is Karen implying she would've just stolen them? Personally I m thrilled when the person in front of me in line only has a couple things I don t get it? Is there another way to pay without getting in line? Two protagonists in the story; OP and skittles for bringing back the lime flavor Haha....awesome. That s literally how I choose which line to go in, by gauging who in front of me has the least items. Karen was just looking for a reason to get mad. I'm so happy Skittles brought back the lime green and got rid of the horrible apple!!!! The apple took over the whole bag in a very unpleasant way. STFU KAREN So sorry to take up 30 seconds of your day for these two items. She was mad because you had *only* two items? Honestly, she s like the poster child for I m only happy when I m miserable. Still, a Karen in a WalMart? Color me shocked. /s/ Best reply though good on you Karen is thinking she would have just put the two items in her pocket and walked out. lol Should have grabbed a third item and said 'there, now I have three items' then when she scoffed again you grab a fourth item. Not a Karen. Just outright rude though. I assumed she was just surprised that you waited in the long line and didn t just ditch the items and leave because it wasn t worth the wait in her opinion. The Karen baseline/quality of yarn has reeeeally dropped in here recently 'take a midol karen, it aint that serious' I would have added 15-20 things I could pick up right there. I m sure she meant that she expected you to use the self-checkout instead. Not that it s any of her business still a Karen! lmao that is a great response You are way too nice. Any person who speaks to a stranger in Walmart deserves stitches. Shut it I cut you Because I m the guy diagnosed and sometimes medicated with short-temperament and a hair trigger, I enjoy challenges requiring patience. Not unlike my doctor no meds needed who requires patients. He cautions me frequently to take my meds so as not to mix my analogies. 'Just to piss you off ol' girl...' The way I would have put more shit on the belt painstakingly slow, than right as the last thing was scanned I would have asked the worker to remove everything but the skittles and vegetables. OMG TAKE MY UPVOTE !!! u slayed ! This. Was there a self checkout? Only thing that makes sense. I work store security. 100% she would've stolen them. Fits the type. Entitled pieces of shit. Right!!?? In fact, on occasion, I ll even tell someone with fewer items to go ahead. Effin Karens . if you pay for wal mart+ you can scan item and pay for them in the app then just walk out. Most Walmarts now are 90% self checkout and have fast lane check out 10 items or less lines. deleted Because of the length of the lines, 2-3 people where in each line surrounded by the belt and candy, so you had to judge it on the last 2-3 only. She probably thought she was sitting pretty getting behind me, but I was only a small part of what took her so long. I chose my line based on closest to the exit I was parked near, since the level of suck was evenly spread across the store. Only available at Walmart. Everywhere else is still apple. Not everyone who is rude is a Karen... Yet every Karen is rude... Is. Maybe they were paying with cash. A lot of self check out Walmarts by me take cards only. Either way you have to pay to leave the store and ultimately she should be happy the person in front of her only has 2 items not 20 lol. Even if there was, still a Karen thing if you re complaining. I never use the self checkout Personally, I'll start using self checkouts when they offer a discount of 10% or more for me to do their job. Until then, I'll wait in line. deleted Definitely. If I have a full cart and you have five things, your going first. I do the same. You have to pay for that??? It s free at our local grocery store which is a chain, not a small stand-alone store . If you have just the app, you can scan items at self checkout, scan QR code on register in app, you can then pay for all items through it. You shouldn t need walmart+ Sounds like Karen should have done this. The express lane was closed. Mpst of our neighborhood markets are self check only. It sucks because I've heard customers are also going to self unload the trucks later this year. Um. Ok then She s just doing her job it s not her fault there isn t a place to sit Also, if I was that dizzy, I would have used instacart or asked a friend for help instead of being an a$$ and treating workers like dirt. And everyone clapped. And the phlebotomist s name? Albert Einstein. Bonus Karen in the comments! Jesus, I hope you didn t drive yourself. Schr dingers Karen. Same here! And the citgo near me, also! You cannot pay cash for gas, you have to buy a prepaid giftcard and then use that at the pump or use a debit/credit card. It's real helpful when they don't have any small denomination cards left. Only need $15 in gas, sorry you have to buy a $50 card to do that. Oh geez, if you d rather wait in line to watch someone else scan all your shit then you go ahead and do the waiting. Scanning some groceries is not a big deal. Many places have customers pump their own gas now too. Change expectations of people working. The answer to automation is not to... stop engineering. It's to take care of people regardless of performance in capitalist arena. UBI bb There are the same amount of cashiers whether there are self checkouts or not. Ever been in a food lion with no self checkouts? Only three lanes open at a time. It sucks. This is THE STUPIDEST comment I ve seen in a while, and your source is garbage. Get a clue. >there can be a lot of legal reasons why it s better not to use them Actuall according to the article just one and it's don't shoplift. Shoplifting at the self check is rampant. I'm betting only 2% of the people Walmart charged with shoplifting did so accidentally as they claim. TLDR - I really shouldn't have to say this but don't steal while using the self check. I ve never seen this anywhere before. What store if you don t mind answering ? Self checkout line was a longer line than the regular lines. You still have to wait in line to scan. With Walmart plus you can scan while shopping and pay on the app and walk out. No scanning, no waiting in line. Sorry if I sound like an ad for Walmart. Haha yes! I could not think of the term That can t be legal. That s just messed up. Do you have any other place to go? Or just save up, buy a bunch of $10 gift cards from Rite Aid, and keep a couple handy so that way they don t get to charge you for the card and the gas. To these people their time is worthless so they'll spend an hour to save a penny. Self service gas has had been a thing for about 50 years - except Oregon and New Jersey If a retailer wants me to scan and bag my purchases I want discount - I pretty much eliminated wallyworld over a year ago due to no check out cashiers. I'll leave a full cart if there is on self check out and 1 cashier - you want to be their free labor, be my guest Right. Too bad in the United States NOT ONE of our multiple governments think like this. Nor in most of our lifetimes will there be opportunity to vote such meisters in. BTT the G figures out UBI is a necessity the entire system will already have collapsed. Then educate instead of belittling someone. One could argue yours is even stupider because it does nothing to provide facts about why the comment is wrong, you could at least provide a link. I exclusively steal from Walmart self check out. It feels morally wrong to go to Walmart and pay for everything I live in Pennsylvania in the U.S., and the store is called Giant Eagle. That does happen but you stood in a single line waiting for a single cashier while those people stood in a much faster moving single line waiting for 10 cashiers. But if you've got the time AND it pisses off a Karen? Win win. Still have to scan the QR code at the self checkout. At my store you still have to scan a QR code on a register to leave. You can t just walk out. They also don t let you skip line to do it. I was very disappointed when it wasn t like scan and go at Sam s. Kind of what I was thinking, too! No, you can drive another 15+ minutes and get to a town with a few more options. They recently became a citgo and now this is the new way. It was fine before they became a citgo, they had pumps you could pay cash at. That s mind boggling to me. Get serious. When have you waited in line at a grocery checkout for an hour? I'd estimate about 5 minutes, 10 minutes tops. If you don't have that much time to spare in your busy life, I sincerely feel sorry for you. Okay, then ask for a discount on gas. See how that goes. Also love how your petty revenge actually creates more work for the people that are there. Just because the store decided to get some self check outs. You're trying to punish a store that probably does millions in sales a year anyway. All the while the only people it actually effects are on the bottom of the ladder. If you don't wanna shop somewhere then don't, but don't act like you're taking a stand against the 'machine' or whatever. If we don t catch up soon we re gonna have a Detroit: Become Human level of unemployment and poverty due to automation before we even have the cool sentient androids Stealing from anyone is wrong g regardless of who your stealing from. The Waltons no doubt are pieces of shit but stealing from them is still wrong. I am patient to a fault at times. If I can walk right up to a self checkout, I use it. Once it is a wait, I would rather someone who gets paid to deal with it handles the cash register and bagging. For me, time in line is people watching time. Are you implying I was talking about standing in line at the grocery store for an hour? I was talking about a type of person and used an a nal o gy. I feel sorry for you wasting 10 minutes because 'I wont work' I definitely have before lmao, where do you live that you haven t? 20 minutes is even normal in some areas in a busy city. deleted Exactly the point I was trying to make - they don t complain about pumping their own gas but god forbid they have to put their groceries in a bag. I mean good for him if his time is less precious than sticking it to Walmart and standing in line for 20 minutes. Where I live full service gas cost more so in fact there is a discount for pumping your own As for petty revenge I don't really know what you're talking about I shot somewhere in good faith and expect to be taken care of if they choose not to take care of me as a customer then they can deal with those consequences I realize that my not shopping at wally world is not going to hurt them in the least however I have discovered from talking to people that more and more people are also not shopping there often for the same reasons I never said I was taking a stand against the machine, I said I was shopping at places that treat me like a customer not an employee That is a subjective opinion. I like the cut of your jib. I assumed you were talking about the actual subject at hand self-checkout and not general queuing involving waits of an hour. Guess that's my bad for assuming that you were staying on topic. I choose not to live in an area where millions of other people are packed together like sardines, so that definitely makes a difference. I just did a cursory search online for grocery store line wait times searching for people complaining about long waits and I'm still going to call hyperbolic BS on a literal hour wait in a checkout line. Triggered so much by someone who simply doesn't want to do the job previously done by cashiers while I shop? You sound stable. If only stores shopped for people in the past and then stopped providing that service without changing prices, your comparison would be apt. Here, even if you go to a cashier, you *still* bag your own groceries. People who complain about self checkout typically cannot run the register to save their life. I'd much rather scan, and bag, my groceries and be out the door *long* before I would make it through one of the 3 registers, each with 15 people in line. I'm curious - if there were both self-serve gas and full-serve gas available at the same station at the same price, which would you choose? And as an aside, I can't remember ever standing in a grocery line for over 10 minutes in my life. Usually all of 5 minutes. If you can't handle that horrible wait, I guess that's on you. I said ask for one, like you think you deserve from store. Also once again it's not the floor level employees that are making the big decisions. Like adopting self check out. You leaving a cart full is doing nothing but disservice to the people that are there to help you. They have no control over the larger decisions. Like I said if you don't wanna shop anywhere then don't. Don't complain when more places adopt self check out and you eventually have no where to shop. Because that's the way we're going. Lol, scanning a few things is too difficult, but pumping gas isn't. Might sprain your wrist I suppose. Why, because they are rich and won't miss it? A homeless man could say the same about you. You've got almost infinitely more money than them and a job so you can earn more. $20 isn't going to break you so why shouldn't they be able to take it from you? Because online stats encompass every experience in the US. Consider yourself lucky, I was born here and can t afford to move. I ve seen it as a customer and as a Sam s Club employee. deleted Go back to FB. I would choose self service. I don t need someone else to pump my gas. I would pump my own gas. I don t feel the need to have people wait on me hand and foot. And yes my time is precious to me and I ve definitely waited in line quite awhile in grocery stores that have no self check outs and only 2-3 lanes open. Then you have to stand there watching someone else scan and bag your groceries while making small talk. Nah man, let me just scan my shit, put it in a bag, pay, and get out of there so I can spend more time living my life. Even if you choose not to do self check out, the fact that you think they should give you a discount if you did choose to use it is just silly. There would be the same amount of cashiers regardless. Self check out gets more people out the door. Well I don't know how to tell you this but there's plenty of places where I live that even though they have self-service also have multiple registers open. Wally world used to be all about customer service they wouldn't even open up extra lines if there were more than three people waiting. As to hurting the people that work there because they have to put groceries back my heart is just breaking for them. When I'm getting ready to spend a couple of $100 and the store can't be bothered to check and bag my groceries I'm going to leave it there and who cares. I am so sorry this offend you I hope you're able to get over it I get a discount for pumping my own gas I don't get a discount for scanning my own groceries how hard is that to understand. As a matter of fact it's a sizable discount over a dollar a gallon And I might add I used to live on the border of New Jersey and then later on the border of Oregon, guess where I got almost all of my gas. Oddly enough it was not only the same price itself served sometimes it was a little bit less. They would also bring you out of soda if you wanted one They can and have and I didn't sweat it. Ownership is a myth. If you are really comparing stealing from a multi-billion dollar company to stealing from a regular person then you need to get a grip on reality. Yeah $20 won t break the bank for *most* people, not even all and the person that stole it from me probably needed it more than I did, but there s still a *huge* difference between stealing $20 from your average joe, and stealing literally anything from a company so large that they literally tell their employees not to go after shoplifters because the stolen item is easily covered by excess funds set aside specifically *for that reason.* Because anecdotes on the internet are complete proof something happened? Surely if something like that is as commonplace as you imply, we'd find plenty of people bitching about hour long lines online. I failed to find any in my search, maybe you can? ETA: https://homafiles.info/2009/08/20/how-long-do-you-wait-in-line-to-checkout-at-the-supermarket/ https://homafiles.info/2009/08/20/how-long-do-you-wait-in-line-to-checkout-at-the-supermarket/ I sincerely doubt we've gone from those times in that link to an hour since 2009. Again, you sound very stable. That's sarcasm, JIC you didn't get that. I'm glad I don't get triggered like you do over what other people do. Life wouldn't be very fun. Just know I support your choice to scan things for yourself. You're the true hero here. Have a great day. Try to settle down a little too. Being that high strung isn't healthy. Not offended, just think it's funny you think these places owe you anything. You can choose where to shop, sure. Just when the inevitable comes. Don't bitch about it. Okay good for them, doesn't mean other places owe you a hand job. You can defiantly choose where you wanna shop. But just don't complain when most places are self check out and you have no where to go. Cause that's the way were going. Send me your next paycheck. Ownership is a myth. The laws we set as a society either apply to everyone or no one. Lmao There s no point in complaining if it happens all the time. That article is also 14 years old. If the inevitable comes, more and more people will opt for other options. By the way you seem to have some sort of fantasy Life about me going into grocery stores and loading up carts and then walking out. This is something that happened once over a year ago now where I had well over $300 worth in a cart and no registers. Now I don't work for them and if they don't want to work for me I'll find someplace else that does I don't know how to tell you this but there are plenty of places that still have good customer service. I never said by the way that anybody owed me anything I said I don't like the way they do business and I'm going to choose to do business elsewhere. Guess what I haven't had any trouble finding places to do business with. You are sadly misinformed, seems that the problem with what retailers euphemistically called shrink has only grown with the growth of self-checkout Yes, there's definitely a point in complaining if you're regularly waiting an hour in line at your grocery store - which, again, I sincerely doubt you are. And I conceded the age of the article. Do you honestly think we went from sub-10 minute average wait times to an hour in 14 years? Does that actually sound logical or realistic in any way to you? Maybe you can find something more recent that backs up your BS. I'll wait. I m not going to research wait lines for a Reddit argument over something this meaningless lmao. If you don t want to believe me, I don t care. Again, if it's as common as you imply, there should not be much searching involved to find instances of it. And I agree - trying to defend your anecdote is a waste of time since it's complete BS. Have a great day! You sure are winning on the internet lmao For not caring you sure do seem to respond quite a bit. Again, have a great day! Because you re hilarious and I can t help myself. Again, have a great day! surejan.gif nice meme from 2014, sure showed me Yep, it sure did. Even old memes can be quite effective, huh? Keep on showing how much you don't care about this conversation, kiddo. I'm done for the day. I'll even give you the last word here, so make sure to make it a good one. You re finally done?",

Poster was determined to be TA and the post was removed.  * I m sorry I called you a bitch, Bitch! * Yea. He ll be stuck with her the rest of his life or someone will game end him next time he pulls the tough guy routine Well said. They need to be withered with invective on the spot. None shall pass Wweeeeeeeeeellllllll.... Too many questions, bitch. This is not made up. This younger person was the annoying bitch/cunt. I was just trying to cross the street. Aren t you just precious? The guy seemed like he was ready to beat me up. Thanks for your kind words. Thanks. The guy seemed like he was about to beat me up. He was seething with anger and eyes raging with fury. I d like to live a little longer. This really happened to me. After the incident, I realized that I can t control others actions/reactions, only my own. The guy that was in my face seemed liked he was ready to beat me up, but I remained as calm as possible. This dude has the right answer, but this post sounds like a karma farm... And you, well put also! If they walk away with their head held high, then you have failed. What? I command you, as king of the Britons, to stand aside! Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom... Wow, passive agressiveness on the internet. It makes sense why you apologized, you're clearly a woman I m not a tough guy by any means but I m an inherent smart ass so when someone gets mad and feeds me a line like did you call someone a bitch? that s my fianc e! Its just flex for me to crack a joke. In the case, it would have been a variation of an old Robert Townsend joke, about you can t call a guy s bitch a ho. Which as my wife was quick to point out would probably have gotten my ass kicked or shot nowadays. Exactly! You re clearly insensitive. Hey wait a minute- isn't yelling 'bitch' to someone also insensitive? I mean at least I can commit to my insensitivity",

		"body": "so about 2 weeks before christmas there's an event that was happening just outside the mall entrance nearest to us later that evening. except neither I or the previous shift supervisor knew about it so I don't prepare any more stuff for cooking hoping to use whats left for the rest of a quiet night. so it's just me and 2 juniors and once the event ends all these families come inside to have some dinner before heading home, instead of going to the food court on the other side of the mall they see that we're open and all head to us. very quickly we're swamped in cooking with about 15-20 large orders with more on the way which we have no prep for. I'm cooking with the more experienced junior while the newest one 13 is handling orders as he doesn't know how to cook yet. I start hearing a woman and her husband raising their voices demanding for their food as they've been waiting nearly 20 mins and I hear my junior telling them that it's nearly done and we're just a bit flooded with orders at the moment. I'm activly walking out of the kitchen at this point to tell them we're plating there food now when I start hearing her go off her tree about how 'it's not fucking good enough' and other colourful things at my junior. He then says what all CS workers wish they could say and tells her 'if it's not good enough then she can piss off'. her husband immediately pulls the hanging plexi-glass aside and practically lunges at him over the counter shouting about how dare he say that to his wife. I bodily pull my junior away from him as he does that, and tell the husband I'm giving their money back and that they need to leave before I call security. they scream at me for a bit as I do actually call security but quickly leave when the show up. thankfuly the other patrons were more understanding and the owner came down ten mins or so later to help out as he had checked in on the cameras and saw how screwed we were. Edit: Because a lot of people were asking, this happened in Australia where the minimum age is 13. he only does 3 hour shifts for 3 evenings a week and we don't treat him as if he has to perform at adult levels. he was a kid of one of the owners friends, getting some work experience and extra pocketmoney doing half-shifts on what was supposed to be quiet evenings. the owner has contacted police though nothing has come from that yet",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* What is wrong with people these days If you still have that surveillance footage, you could contact the police. If they've been caught doing this, chances are they're going to do this to the next customer service worker who crosses them. People treating actual children like shit. Stellar. Yep this right here is why I don't work in food service anymore. I did for over a decade and don't miss it! Fuck these entitled cunts. Should 13 years old even have jobs yet? I mean I refereed some sports and did side jobs. I am in the US and was 12 when I started working. This is definitely NOT uncommon here. There is a restriction on the amount of hours that is it. Younger than that doing corn detasseling for farms here. Still have my young signature on the SS card issued to me to do so. And they still didn't get their food...they should have just been patient. 13 year old's response is gold. I think there should be more of this. Money back dumped on the counter, get out and don't come back. None of this multiple warnings and 'customer is always right' nonsense yes I know there is more to that phrase. Here's your money, get out of the shop. How miserable of a human does one have to be to freak out so badly about waiting for your order. That close to snapping over a minor inconvenience. What is the rest of their life like? I m sure they claim to be good Christians. 'I'm pissed over fast food not being fast, so I'm going to assault someone.' Oh and I'm going to assault a minor. As a rule, I let people get that mad with me so when they DO hit, I can press charges. As someone who has worked in customer service, that kid is my hero ! gif giphy 3o7TKF1fSIs1R19B8k What Karen and Darren did, most places would consider this to be child abuse or, at the very least, child endangerment. I'm sure local authorities would love to see the surveillance footage of those 2 I bet the 13 year old kid coulda taken him either way, any grown 'man' who feels the need to try and assault a minor is far from a man, specially one that's pussy-whipped like that by a Karen. Imagine yelling at a 13 year old. That's one of life's failures right there. Being so unhappy with your shitty little life that waiting 20 minutes warrants cussing out a 13 year old. I'm so happy he told them off. If I worked there I would have laced into them much harder. As a person who's solely worked in CS so far in life, fuckin hate at least 30% of the people I've dealt with Reason I say 30 is because, not sure if it's my personality or how I just happen to handle situations, but I get/got a lot of people whether at that point or them returning later in the day, apologizing and explaining they were just having a shit day or whatever, and I kinda learned to tell the difference of who was having a shit day and who was either just a prick or was giving the indication of them just being a prick I would have kicked them out and called the police no refund for you. Screw that, you should have called the cops on their unhinged asses. The pea brained troglodite was about to assault a minor, he should not get away with that. At least your boss was nice enough to come down to help, most bosses I ve felt with are shit and won t lift a finger to help unless they are held legally liable Ok for wife to be an abusive asshole but god forbid some reply to he abuse. Hope the kid didnt get in trouble. The Karens should always be treated exactly lije that Is 13yo legal to work? Just curious My feelings is that a lot of this aggression to customer service people, or strangers even, is a combination of the past Covid lock downs and the frustration that went with it, and more and more time spent on the internet. People have gotten used to saying whatever the hell they want without suffering any of the consequences, other than getting banned from a forum or sub-reddit, something along those lines. They get into the real world, forget to turn their filter back on, and then act all shocked when those consequences rear their ugly head. You need to walk out of the kitchen with a bloody cleaver when addressing assholes. What do you mean by how screwed you were? just asking Don't you love how owners and managers show up after the fact? They're just be a Playbook somewhere. A&E is never going to run out of content for their 500 new security camera footage shows KAREN....' I don't care that you are a human with emotions and can't control how long food takes, I WANT IT NOW.' Also what kind of dbag adult male lunges at a 13 year old A 13 year old? The owner could see cameras? how swamped you guys were the whole time and only came to help when they saw one of you get assaulted? Real nice. But yeah, fuck that Karen. where do you live that a13 year old is allowed to work in a restaurant? Where is a thirteen year old allowed in the kitchen?When we offered the kids of the people that worked for us jobs in the summer, there were strict regulations on what they could do. Edited for typo. Why is a 13 year old working at a restaurant in the mall? A 13 year old is working as a cook? Where the hell is this? who tf is hiring 13 year olds?!? In most civilized countries child labour is illegal especially for 13yr olds WTF. I can t believe 13 year olds are allowed to work. Ugh. Poor kid. Why are 13 years old children working? In which third world country is a 13 year old working? Why is a 13 year old working in a restaurant No one gonna question a 13 year old working in a restaurant? Way too young. Illegal in my jurisdiction. They thought a 13 year old was easy prey ain't that the question They all feel ENTITLED These people were always assholes, they just never had as many challenges as simple as they may be. There is also not enough 'find out' happening for all the 'fuckaround' through covid Right? Who the hell makes 13 year olds work in a situation like this-or any for that matter? Their mommies and daddies were neglectful and never taught them... Well anything so they never learned how to grow up to be adults, mentally they're toddlers Especially people that go off on you but get upset when it's given back. I feel like it'd be quicker to list all the things that *isn't* wrong with people these days lmao They ve been told it s okay to be a piece of garbage to others. People have always sucked. It is just that in the States, the orange headed douche bag made it OK to go public. The boomer generation is quickly is slipping into cognitive decline because all the lead they were exposed to as children permanently settled in their brains. We're going to be seeing a massive uptick in dementia and Alzheimer's in the near future. Packed care facilities will be unprepared for the massive wave of elderly that bounce between screaming about not getting their way and being violent with their caretakers They'll never know happiness again because, between the lead and media exploiting the cognitive decline, any shred of joy was burned out of them long ago. We're just going to have to grit our teeth and look away as they throw tantrums like spoiled children until the last of them fizzles out. Once they're buried we can finally start working on fixing all the problems they caused. If a customer tries to assault an employee, I don't think you are required to provide a refund. That's because they don't see any person in a service position as human. Child, teen, adult, minor, etc, don't mean anything if you don't consider them a person in the first place. Its the same in Hotels. Left hotel management 6 months into Covid after dealing with people spitting at my employees for asking them to wear masks, physically assaulting valets/bellmen for trying to follow basic pandemic safety protocols, and just the general entitlement that people feel when they interact with service workers. I mean he only does 3 hour shifts for 3 evenings a week and we don't treat him as if he has to perform at adult levels. I started working at 13. It allowed a degree of independence I could only have dreamed of while allowing me to spend a minimal amount of time at my unhappy home life. Not only has he earned that job, he has earned a pay rise for telling Karen to piss off. Lol. Actually, under 14 agriculture work is like the ONLY work allowed outside of shit like paper routes, baby sitting, or house chores such as snow shoveling or grass mowing You must live in farm land! 'Under 14 - Children under 14 years of age may not be employed in non-agricultural occupations covered by the FLSA. Permissible employment for such children is limited to work that is exempt from the FLSA such as delivering newspapers to the consumer and acting . Children may also perform work not covered by the FLSA such as completing minor chores around private homes or casual baby-sitting.' https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/43-child-labor-non-agriculture#:~:text=Minimum%20Age%20Standards%20For%20Employment&text=Children%20of%20any%20age%20are,has%20declared%20to%20be%20hazardous. yep Always. That's why it's acceptable. They'd do the same thing to their kids. Depending on the flavor of Christian they claim to be, of course. Not sure Aussies suffer from these claims that much. As someone who hasn t worked in customer service but might soon, that kid is also my hero. nah the owner thought he could of said it a bit more politely to try defuse the situation but he's firmly on his workers side when ever stuff like this happens He probably doesn t watch the cameras 24/7 it is likely he only randomly checked it. australia. he was a kid of one of the owners friends, getting some work experience and extra pocketmoney doing half-shifts on what was supposed to be quiet evenings There's no age on the other junior, but it says the 13yo was handling orders, not cooking That's definitely not the way it's done in the US, but not everywhere is the US. This. These cowards only go after the ones they feel that they can intimidate. That and they didn't like being called out by a 13 year old. You are a better person than me. I wouldn t have returned the money. I would consider it a convenience fee for not pressing an assault charge I feel entitled to know the answer to that question. Entitlement noun - What s what s wrong with people these days. Why was your junior cussing at customers? Shitty parenting? But the same people who tend to feel so entitled also hate the idea of *federal entitlements*, like Medicare and social security. Go figure. Didn t we used to have child labor laws? removed Yes. Came to say the same thing. Wow. That went there >We're just going to have to grit our teeth and look away as they throw tantrums like spoiled children until the last of them fizzles out. Once they're buried we can finally start working on fixing all the problems they caused. jesus christ removed Oh fuck off. My god. you're probably right but I was kinda in panic mode and just wanted them to leave Same in the airline industry. At least I had the option to basically kick them off and ban them. Are you outside of the U.S.? 14 is the minimum age for employment in the U.S. 14 & 15 can work for a limited number of hours and restricted duties. Can't perform any hazardous work. For example, in retail and 14 & 15 year old is not supposed to go into a walk-in cooler or freezer. I guess I can see that in that situation. I just cannot imagine my 13 year old having to deal with that crap. I'd rather they be a kid and play and focus on school and friends. But I'm sure home situation plays a role as you said Imagine the bragging rights this kid will have forever. Yes had Dairy farms a plenty in Wisco. I actually worked at a Dairy Queen thus I had to obtain my SS card as they were not issued at birth when I was young. Which flavor is Australian, as that's where this took place? Happy Cake day! Op said he didn't know how to cook yet, implying that he would be taught soon. I was 12 when I got my first restaurant job in New England They re in for a rude awakening most of the time, then. A lot of the younger folks I know give fewer fucks and take less shit than the generations before them, and their bullshit meters seem well-calibrated Pick on someone your own size that couple is the woooorst Yeah I know kids younger than me that could definitely out intimidate older people, no one should be trying to intimidate anyone but that s just what happens because everyone wants to feel tough you're right but I was kinda in panic mode and just wanted them to leave I demand to speak to the karen. No. Shitty customers who deserved it. Bro, it s a literal child getting cussed out by an adult. I ve seen grown adults lose their cool on a bad day from crappy customers. 13 year olds aren t really known for keeping calm, and he was already stressed from being slammed. One swear word is understandable, and would be understandable for anyone of any age. In fact, when I was in fast food we had employees literally punch another person during there shift and then come back to work, and these were grown adults. Found Karen s husband..! I.. I just severely dislike that you so easily and willfully ignore everything else, and hone in on *that*? Your comment implies that you have never had any kind of real experience in the service industry if that is your take away from this? Although I fully expect you to claim you 'own a restaraunt' or 'I am the CEO of companies, dude' You said SO much to everybody here without having to actually say it.. Have a good day, and remember these are people and not 'the help', you do not get to just hurl insults and attempt to assault them without expecting them to stand up for themselves or defend themselves. Because they deserved it. Some people deserve it / 'Wah! Kids know swears they hear from adults ALL THE TIME and when an adult acted badly, THEY USED A SWEAR!' *has a heart attack and dies from young people* /s If you're gonna emulate someone from Gravity Falls, why did you choose the ghosts who hate teenagers? Only if it s people darker than a paper bag Who said anything about the US boomer? glad you're here. My own mother retweets every homophobic thing she can find because she's incapable of forming her own opinion, and she does this knowing full well that not a single one of her children are straight. It's hard to have pity for them. The lead exposure want coming from paint chips. It was leaded fuel additive to make engines stop knocking. The lead came out in the exhaust and was in the air. It was inescapable. Everyone from that time period was exposed to incredibly unsafe levels of lead. A few boomers may have helped the environment, like the ones that put a stop to CFC usage which allowed the ozone home to repair itself. The majority of boomers have done much worse or at best were entirely complacent. But you may not have known this because you decided you already know everything and didn't bother learning new things like a typical boomer. Go back to bed, lead head. something for you to study up on http://Boomers exposed to higher levels of lead Study suggests link to mental decline in ... http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/lead/Documents/Boomers%20exposed%20to%20higher%20levels%20of%20lead.pdf How I know you're a gigantic asshole- 'Whose to say I won't take a cunt like you with me'. Peak boomer narcissism. Go drink your lead filled Pino and rant at the ceiling in peace. Found one. Lmao I feel that. If they re already acting this entitled I m sure they would have assumed the security guard might have sided with them at least getting that refund and hung around. Where is this that you have a 13 year old running the front? edit nm you answered elsewhere. they could be charged with attempted child abuse for going after the kid. Contact the police and tell them what happened. australia, the minimum age is 13 Definitely outside the US based on the slang terms used in the post Unless your parents own the business, then child labor is fine!/s but not really I really really hate that child labor is considered okay when your parents own a business. To be clear they have to be the SOLE owner and you have to work at THEIR shop. But it can be ANY time slot for ANY hours. You can hire your own CHILD to work 40 hours a week. Some states have certain age restrictions for general its typically 12, mine doesn't, I've seen 7 year Olds working at Chinese food places , federal has restrictions for mining and construction you can't be under 16, 18 for any job the secretary of labor has deemed 'hazardous' You have to get a court order if you're 13 or 14 if its more than a paper route or babysitting. My state minimum age is 15, but good fucking luck getting anything until at least 16 and even then you're getting the shittiest jobs that'll still ask you to do illegal things based on age. And you probably will out of fear of losing your job. Now, keep in mind this is *paid* labor. If you're 'helping your parents business', they're more likely to pull the 'I put a roof over your head, clothe you, feed you, this is what's owed to me!' Card. And let's be real, how many of these kids know any better? Eta: any kids reading this who's helping their parents out running their business with no other employees, your parents suck at being business owners and if you're not getting paid, stop doing it. Edit 2 for source: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/43-child-labor-non-agriculture#:~:text=Minimum%20Age%20Standards%20For%20Employment&text=Children%20of%20any%20age%20are,has%20declared%20to%20be%20hazardous. I used to work at an amusement park and your right about the ages, yet I found out while working there with parents permission you can have 13year olds work there. It's been a couple of years and has changed since then. It was still pretty cool to teach young folk Oh, we are vastly different in age then I assume xD it's been like this since I was in high school, though im not sure of prior shitty parents, led a lot into me learning rights of a minor I've had a ss card since birth, I'm 26. I think it was 1987 when they started the EAB enumeration at birth . My info is only as old as 2010/2011 outside of the link I provided, I actually Googled to make sure I was still correct Word of advice for modern day: get a primary care physician. Just once. Try to go once every 3-5 years. If you ever lose your ss card, birth certificate, AND ID/license, you can use a copy of your last physical to replace the first two to get the third. At least that's how it is in CT. Took me 3 years to replace my ID because I had neither, lost my ID, had no pcp. On the other hand, if you have your info memorized, finding a job should be fine. I got hired at 2 corporate and 2 small business with nothing but a photo of my very expired old id and just knowing my info. Covid Vax cards helped a little more once those happened. Got around needing my id by getting my shots at the place I worked, so the pharmacy knew me well. I still can't believe I got several jobs without a physical ss card. That basically mandatory these days. I reckon it d be a bit spicy. Like a low-mid range chilli. Thanks! I forgot. Cool. Good. Society collectively told the kids to fuck off with what it left them, so it's only right the kids dish it back. Lol me and my sister was saying this about our friend who is 20...she has no filter and just says whatever the fuck she thinks. She goes off on people all the time even our boss. But she is loyal to a fault and just young and crazy. But we were wondering where tf someone gets a personality like that. Lol Oh yeah man You did the right thing. You diffused the situation and got the foul beast and her husband away from your staff quickly. Good on you! I'M OLD :I Ah yes. There it is. You hate your mom so they're all assholes. removed Lol, as the shitty mortal Kombat movie once said- it has begun Bzzz. Nope. Get back to therapy. With parental consent. I was shocked when I came back from 2 days off to be told I will be interviewing a 13yo. I thought it was illegal so I looked it up. To cover our asses, we got her mother to provide written consent. This kid works hard I think in Manitoba it s 16, 15 if your principal sign an authorization form Why? Kids should be kids. Where I live 15 is the minimum but they can only work dayshifts, have more break and they only allowe to work in school breaks r/latestagecapitalism Just for funsies, specifically these phrases: - my junior - CS worker ? - she can piss off Also perhaps have some dinner and multiple uses of the phrase a bit or for a bit . Couldn t have told you OP was Australian though. Maybe if they had written that their Junior exclaimed crikey! when confronted by the Karen. 14 in my state and I lied and said I was sixteen so I didn't have to take my unpaid breaks Get back to antiwork. It was 14 in my state when I was a kid. I started babysitting at 11 or 12 and I started working at Safeway when I turned 14 and loved it. I was able to buy my first car when I turned 16. smart kids can be brutal In summer camp, most of the people working their are pretty crap, often treating the place as their own place to do teenager things and picking on the kids who were smaller than them- the boys started to steal their things and do stuff like put ketchup under the outer rings of the toilet seats so it would squirt into their pants, disabling the cameras when they were sent into the office to pull it off, stealing their Id's and their money, shaking up their soda before they drank it, 1963 was peak lead exposure. It's starting to show. You being awake for 25 hours isn't something to brag about either. Your body needs rest. It's just not healthy to be awake that long. Here's a book you may want to read https://www.amazon.com/A-Generation-of-Sociopaths-audiobook/dp/B01N5VLZNN/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?adgrpid=54515653085&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtvSdBhD0ARIsAPf8oNlFeHeU2Qqbvmew8b_y3KE8OArb1lDfLIVLYfj0pcx5dOwtfbclcJgaAmwEEALw_wcB&hvadid=617005252263&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9007353&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=656777005999872356&hvtargid=kwd-308081638691&hydadcr=15147_13597715&keywords=a+generation+of+sociopaths&qid=1673353133&sr=8-1 Call me a whippersnapper Oh wow. I though with parental consent was 14, 9 months. TIL. That s dumb why does your principal need to say shit about what you do outside of school No one is forces them. I didn't do it when I was young, it wasn't a thing in Romania, but in Canada teens can work in the summer if they want. And they make their own money. Different rules in different places. Oh, and life isn't fair. I loved working as a teen. I started babysitting kids in our area at 12. At 13 I was a volunteer for the summer reading program at our library and as soon as I turned 14 I started working at a grocery store. By the time I was 16 I had enough saved to buy my first car. It gave me a serious edge over the other kids after graduation because I had far more work experience than most of the others. Nah it was actually off her tree, and bodily for me, the other things seemed pretty normal Yikes, why would you do that to yourself 14 here as well, and 'nintendos....' sounds like a bitter child. Already there babyyyyy Get off my lawn. I was about to comment this. I didn t know that had changed. Was 14y, 9m for as long I can remember. Probably meaning 'guardian'. Because what you do outside of school affects schools. Working all the time, can t do homework. Don t know why it changes at 16 Ah nice! Although I can t say I agree with the bodily one. I feel like that s something I would maybe say as an American. But maybe I m unusual. Edit: no, you re totally right. I would say physically . Cuz poor and 14 When you get older you will understand where they come from. You won t remember this in 25 years, but if you did you d acknowledge I was right. Bro I'm 26 but alright Lmao that was actually funny. Thank you Where did the 9 months come from?! No Principal at school I ve never heard someone use that word except maybe bodily fluid, and I m not even sure if that s correct lmaoo Well it takes time to be born obviously/s What's the gestation period of an adult female homo sapiens? Lol damn good question!! adverb 1. by moving a person's or one's own body with force. 'he hauled her bodily from the van' That makes sense honestly yea",

However, the Karen who lives on our left 70s maybe, married thinks she owns the entire front street parking in front of her home - even when their cars are not there and they are clearly not home. Last night I had a friend over from 6pm-9:30pm. She happened to park in front of the neighbors house since both me and my boyfriend were parked in front of our home since we had been home all day. I didn t think to check where she parked since it s 1 . a public road 2 . not a big deal. Anyway today my boyfriend comes in the house asking what color car my friend has since the neighbors are bitching about someone parking in front of their house. They re apparently asking anyone who walks by who owns the car Now I ve lived here 2ish years now and knew about their stupid preference - which is what it is - but I don t put it as top priority because I am not friends with neighbors. I say the polite hello and how are you if I have to but I usually stay away because I m busy with my own life and all our neighbors are significantly older than us. I just think it s hilarious how they think they own the street and have rights to park there and no one else. If she asks me who parked there I will be honest and say that I invited a friend over and that s that and walk away. Not trying to cause an argument but also not going to enable an elderly Karen and her husband by agreeing to not have anyone park in front of their house. Build a driveway if you re that salty.",

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit /message/compose/?to=/r/FuckYouKaren if you have any questions or concerns.* I live on a cul-de-sac and the stretch in front of my house is the only one that is straight and not curved, making it the ideal place to park. I have a driveway, so it's not a big deal. My neighbor at the far end of the cul-de-sac, who has like 8 feet of street front because of the way the lots are laid out, has a huge family and big weekend gatherings. They were so worried when I moved in that I would make a stink about the parking. Nope. Anyone gets to park on the street. I don't own it. They bring me food every weekend as a thank you. I keep telling them it's no big deal, but apparently other neighbors give them hell. And the food is soooo yummy. The only thing that pisses me off is when someone parks DEAD CENTER in front of my house. If you pull forward all the way to where my driveway starts or back up to where my neighbors driveway starts, you can easily fit two vehicles there. If you park like a complete dick right in the middle, then that s it just your selfish ass taking two spots and forcing my friends or neighbors to drive around looking for another spot. I had a neighbor like this. They didn't let THEIR FRIENDS park in front of their house, to the point the friends would block my tiny driveway. I started parking RIGHT Infront of their walkway to their door which was street parking, but jerk move parking . They kept trying to get my car towed, and would be mad when they got a ticket from the police for false police reports. Not mad to have moved They would also steal whoever's trash can was cleanest. Weird weird folks There's a woman a street over from me with a big sign on her tree that reads: 'if everyone parks in front of their house, everyone has a spot.' Umm....no doll, that's not how it works. My boyfriend parked in front of our neighbors house one day because it is the same side of the street that he drives on when he comes home otherwise has to turn the car around or park the wrong way . The neighbor asked him to either back up or pull forward because it bothered his cat to see it in front of the window lol then he corrected himself later to say he actually thinks the cat liked the car in front of the window Been there myself. I parked across the street from a friend s house and the homeowner came out to tell me I couldn t park there. I told them I could because it was public property and I d be happy to talk to the police about it if Karen insisted on calling them. I have a friend with a neighbor like that. He has two apartments in his building and doesn't let them park in the driveway. Shortly after he my friend moved in, I went to visit, and parked in front of his place. No signs, no parking stickers. I walked down to the corner to grab a coffee from the Dunkin, and when I came back, he was prowling around my car with some sort of bar. Not entirely sure what it was, it wasn't slim enough to be a jimmy, nor thick enough to bust a window . So I ask him if I can help him? Sure enough he starts screaming at me about how it's his space because it's in front of his house. Starts threatening me with calling the cops. I told him to go ahead... and walked in a very wide berth around him... and took a lap around the block because I didn't want to drag him to my friend's door, but he ended up going door to door the next day to scream at all his neighbors about it. My neighbor is a mechanic shop and he re-did the parking lot with some nice fresh concrete awhile ago. Near the end of his concrete is lined to match the end my *yard* on my side instead of going all the way out to the road. So there is concrete but the yellow line makes it seem like you shouldn't park that far over or you are in the road instead of his parking lot. So basically, people will pull up and park in what they think is the 'street' but is really the end of his parking lot/start of my lawn. Inevitably following the straight-line-of-cars theory someone will park fully on my lawn on the opposite side of my driveway, or block my driveway. That's my yard. Get off my lawn you damn kids. I have a neighbor that throws parties on a regular basis. They live on a corner and have driveway on each side and two sides of the street- yet the guest always park in front of our house . As they should cuz I don t own the street. I don t even understand people. I love living in the woods no neighbors I had a neighbor call 911 for us parking in the street in her 'dads spot' , she even tried demanding the police arrest me for being a prostitute because *she'd never seen that car before so clearly i don't live here* it was a rental!! . Her karen ass didn't even have a fucking car and oh yea *had 2 spots in the driveway*! We avoided her and parking in that spot after that like the plauge. Literally the most unpleasant person i have ever met in my life and they're only 22. During covid 'lockdown' we were allowed out within our own area, but weren't allowed to travel to other areas of the city. Karen posted on Facebook if anyone knew who owned the car outside her home, close to the start of a short bush walk lots of people were using for exercise during the lockdown. Her reason 'we need to park our boat there' - as well as other comments about inconsiderate people... She got absolutely smashed in the comments, tried to delete it but the comments followed, followed her to other SM platforms too. It was glorious. Had someone leave a note on my car telling me I wasn t allowed to park in front of their house on a public street with marked public parking my apartment was beside their house . I balled it up and threw it back in their yard while they watched kinda rude, but I was young and dumb and then proceeded to park in front of their house every single time I came home for the next 3 months. They tried calling the police on me LOL but that didn t work out for them I knew some of the cops, they told me about it , as the cops told them each time that what I was doing was perfectly legal. I am just petty enough that I would start parking in front of their house every freaking day Had a naybour like that also had a car with a broken clutch and gear box, can you guess where I put it for three weeks before I scrapped it I ve seen this situation on Neighborhood Watch and it never ends well for the karen. Not excusing Karen, but... When I was growing up, a vacant lot just across the road from us had a furniture shop built there. No real issues, but after a few years it closed, and a huge toy shop opened up. My brother and I thought it was fantastic. However, this shop had very limited customer parking. Then the first Christmas came along, and the parking was atrocious. People actually would park in our driveway so they didn't have to walk a few more meters to the shop! The street itself was quite narrow, so we often couldn't even get out of our driveway, due to people parking so close to our gate. That was just over Christmas. I'd hate to deal with school traffic 5 days a week for most of the year! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0UdL4Xg84o Buy a shit box car and park it center in front of her home so that it fucks her on all her parking. Leave it there for a year! Please invite all of your friends over at separate times and insist they park outside her house. Keep at it and the stupid cow will have a stroke. Problem solved. You would be surprised at the number of people who think that their owner/renter rights extend all the way onto the public property around their domicile. I ve run across a few in my years, but seen even more pop up on Reddit for stories just like this I don t get it but some people be like that. My neighbor punctured all tires to multiple vehicles but we caught him on video. District Attorney is pursuing charges and we are pursuing civil charges. The only time I ve ever complained to a neighbor about their parking was when I had next door neighbors who would consistently block our driveway. Other than that to complain would be to Karen. I live on a corner and have tons of street parking. I don t own the street obviously and idc when people park there. We don t have sidewalks just curbs, so landscaping goes to the street. I have a great neighbor with lots of friends with big ass trucks who d hop the curb and park on my plants because they dont want their trucks hit. After the third time my neighbor frog walked his friend over and made him apologize like he s 10. Funniest fucking thing I ve ever seen. He also replaced the roses. They stopped parking next to my yard completely. I m super curious how that went down. I had a neighbor like this. They would always park on my side of the street and i never said anything. Its a pubic fucking street. I had parked my car on their side for a few days without moving it. They left me a nasty note saying i would be towed. Lololololol silly rabbits that dont work on public streets. We saw who it was from our security cameras. Now every time one of their friends or family park on our side i leave them a copy of the same note. I made 1000 copies of it. I find posts like this so hilarious, living in UK cities the idea that you will be able to park outside your own house - or in anyway influence who takes a parking spot is crazy. You find a spot as close to your house as possible and park. No more. If you have a driveway great but if it s street parking you may be lucky to even get on your own street. I don't like when people park in front of my house because I have severe anxiety and also very happy dogs. That being said, I would NEVER tell someone they couldn't park there or openly complain if they did. The street is public parking, like it or not. Had a neighbor at my parents place that was the same way. Parked my car near her driveway and she came over to ask that my car get moved since it was to close to her driveway and she might run into it. I said no, but my parents were the peacemakers and insisted that I move it. There s one in every neighborhood. My neighbor has a garage and a driveway, uses neither for their intended purpose, and has been known to PUSH a car parked a few inches into HIS area. I will never understand why people care of cats park in front of their house My in-laws have the exact same situation - neighbors are entitled assholes who think they own the public sidewalk/road in front of their house. Even called the cops several times on my in-law's guests due to a vehicle that parked in front of their house on several occasions. I always offer to my in-laws to talk to their neighbors and set them straight on the law, but they don't want to cause conflict. If they were my neighbors, I would park in front of their house everyday after they tried to pull that shit on me once. I am very petty. I had a neighbour like that many years ago. The house I lived in was in the second row to the street, behind said neigbours house. There was a driveway to our house, but I couldn't park there, because it would block my landlords garage, so I had to park on the street. The neigbour was ~75 years old and basically sat at her window, staring at the street most of the day. Every time she saw someone parking there, she opened the window and screamed at the driver, that they are parking on her property, that those spaces were reserved for her family and threatened to call the police. Of course, she never did, because she probably knew that it was a publich street and parking there was completely legal. She was just trying to intimidate the drivers. One time, some friends visited and parked there for a few hours. They later told me, that the neighbour verbally attacked them when they left, claiming that they were parking there for days, which just wasn't true. After dealing with her a few times, I just avoided her by parking a few meters away. Most of the time there was enough parking space for everyone and no reason at all to get into a fight about it and I just had better things to do than argue with her. I don't habe entitled or annoying neighbors, but I'm a person that doesn't play well with Karens, Chads, Kevins, etc. If I'd been asked if I know the cars owner, that parked in 'their' territory I'd simply said 'yes'. If they don't get the hint and continue pestering me with further nonsense like 'Tell them not to park in front of our house' I reply with a stern 'No!' If that still doesn't sink in and they ask who they are I'd reply 'I'm not going to corrupt myself by ratting out people I like and value to selfproclaimed wannabe neighborhood deputies. Now, stop pestering me!' I would love an update on this! Old people's worlds tend to shrink to the size of their yard and sometimes to what's in front of it. Honestly, it's more sad than anything else. I've caught my dad getting furious about the same thing and had to have a serious talk with him about what constitutes being a good neighbor of twenty years, in that particular case . In my city, that is actually illegal. The city owns the streets and even painting your house number on the curb is illegal. Next time she makes a stink or tells people not to park there, tell her that the police should weigh in and then call the non-emergency line and request officer assistance. Check your codes first, of course . I had a Karen across the street come out at like 2am to yell at my friend for parking in front of her house even left a rude ass note . I offered to clear up the matter with the folks in blue and surprisingly she never said a word to anyone after that. Let her call the police on your friend s car. They will inform her in no uncertain terms that the street is a free-for-all. People are definitely possessive about street parking. Our road layout is: imagine an upside down T, and we live on the crossbar to the right of the stem. There would be enough room outside our house for two cars if they park really close to each other, but there s a pedestrian crossing, so no one can can park there. We re friendly with the neighbors just across the street in the corner of the upside down T. Their driveway is on our street, as is the driveway of the neighbors on the other side of the T stem, so there s plenty of parking down the T stem. They park a big RV which they haven t moved for months on their side of the T stem and a couple of cars on the other side. There is still usually room for a couple more cars there. They don t use their driveway for whatever reason. We had visitors staying for a week but they couldn t park outside our house, so we let them have the driveway while I parked on the T stem, across the street from the aforementioned neighbors. In our city you are allowed street parking for up to 48 hours but you re supposed to move before then or it ll consider the car abandoned, but you can park back in the same spot. The city doesn t enforce it unless they get a complaint, in which case they ll give you a warning followed by being towed and a fine. Well, of course, the first morning after I parked there maybe 12 hours after I d parked, I found a warning ticket. Our neighbor had complained to the city. They apologized after finding out it was my car I couldn t tell you what car they drive so I guess we re both not very observant but it was a shitty thing to do even if we were strangers. Anyone is entitled to park there. It would have been petty of me to complain about their RV but I was tempted. First and foremost if someone parks in front of my house I would never go out and say anything. It s a public street. Having said that, I have no idea why but it does bother me a bit. I know it shouldn t, I know it s a public street, but it still does. Again let me clarify, I m not talking about when one of my neighbors is having a party and cars are everywhere, that s perfectly fine. I m talking about when my street is empty and someone parks in front of my house. Why didn t they park in front of their own house or if they are visiting, why not park in front of their friend s house? It must be territorial I guess. Rationally I know it s okay. My parents still live in the house I grew up in. It's a small dead end street and they have multiple neighbors who behave like this. There are three or four neighbors who have started blocking off the street parking in front of their houses with cones or handmade handicap parking signs when they're not home. I filed a complaint because if I visit my parents' house, there's absolutely no parking and just cones blocking off multiple empty public spaces, but nothing ever came of it. It's not a great neighborhood and I'm aware that a lot of houses have cameras now so I don't feel comfortable moving their cones, even if I firmly believe they are in the wrong, because I'm scared someone might damage my car or worse. The entitlement is so frustrating. Of course everyone wants to park right in front of their house, but if having a reserved parking spot is that important to you, get a house with a garage. You're paying for a house with street parking so you get a house with street parking. You should park your personal vehicle right in front of her house every single day. I mean you are right, but if they really are in their 70s it may be harder for them to walk longer distances? So it would be a neighborly thing to allow them to have it, if available? At 70 knees hurt, hips, hurt, backs hurt. They just do. If I had a neighbor who is 70 or older, I would do my best to make sure they could park near their house. It is kind of a neighborly thing to do whether you are friends or not. Building a driveway cost money and it s 70. They are probably on a fixed income. On the other hand I ve had people do this on a Sunday night, and trash collection is Monday morning meaning I have nowhere to put my bins Bro I don t want people parking in front of my house and using MY yard to walk in like it s a sidewalk. The amount of trash that ends up due to this is crazy Ok but if you're actually trying to be a good neighbor you would put their desire to have parking in front of their house at the top of your list enough to not have your friend park there. This belongs on r/aita deleted Let s be honest here: it s a dick move to park in front of someone else s house when there is space in front of the house you re going into. BUT . Dick moves are not illegal. They re not technically even wrong or bad, and as much as I don t like them, I m not the dick move police. If I want to avoid this annoying circumstance, my best move is to be a good enough neighbor that my neighbors won t want to do a dick move on me. If that doesn t work, we ll it s my tough luck. Not seeing how they are being a Karen? They didn t come yell at you or act entitled based of the info you gave . So they re asking people if it s their car . You have no idea if her intention is to be a Karen . This kinda reads like you might be a Karen yourself . Just saying As long as I have enough room to back out and back into my driveway. I couldn't care less. Had one neighbour who didn't think the same. Ok who cares? Until I caught him on my ring camera scratching my truck. The company I work for didn't take too kindly the fact the guy damaged ' their' property. Never had another problem with him. Always would greet him with a big smile. Around here, it s up for grabs where to park. I do however try to leave a car length from someone s driveway in case they have someone over/work being done, etc. Common courtesy There's a guy who lives round the corner from my parents who doesn't like people parking anywhere in front of his house he has a drive so it's not that he has nowhere to park if someone were parked outside his house . It's a terraced street so if someone has more than one car it's impossible for everyone to park in front of their houses. This guy is so insistent that nobody parks in front of his house that he has put screws and nails on the road in front of his house. If someone parks there and there's no nails / screws there has been multiple occasions of people coming back to their cars with slashed tyres. People have gone to the council about him but he works for the council so the complaints get buried. There is a family that owned most of the houses on the street owned my one guy who passed away a few years ago and left the houses to a military charity so it's only a couple houses the family owns now that are not to be messed with, there was one day where one of their car tyres ended up slashed. The guy hasn't put nails / screws down since and nobody has had their tyres slashed for parking outside his house. My wife complains when people park in front of the house. No amount of logic about public streets will changer her opinion We have a church at the end of the block. If they use the street in front of our house we park somewhere else. We like to park right in front of our house, but we don t own it. I used to have neighbors that had a very large family, their kids and guests would park in front of my house every single day. I never had any extra space for my guests, like not exaggerating the only days I ever had space in front of my house was when their family went on vacation. It annoyed me a bit, but it is what it is, I don't own the streets and where else are they supposed to park? My neighbor across the street left a note on my ex-girlfriends car that said 'park infront of your boyfriends house' as if she thought she owned the road. Some people..... Oh man, prob not uncommon but in my area people will go buy signs or cones and put them up in front of their homes, even when they have a driveway &/or garage, to try and make it look like the city said no parking. Most people just move them but it s still so silly. There are many people like this, who think that they are the only ones who should park directly in front of their own homes. I've received notes on my car when I parked in front of someone's home that I was not going to see. There have been many neighbor altercations over this issue. I'd suggest that any future visitors be advised to not park in front of Karen's house, but to choose any of the other places around your home. I did have to deal with a guy who was working on the home across the alley from me. I have a very wide alley, where a line of cars can park and cars can still easily drive by. This joker decided he would just park in the middle of the alley, between my garage and my neighbor's, where he was working, when there were at least 4 other places to park that wouldn't block my garage or the alley. This prevented me from leaving my garage. This is the kind of person who hasn't figured out that he is not the center of the universe and needs to find somewhere else to park. I get annoyed when people park high sided vehicles in front of the house, but that s because if blocks out all the light no real front garden but I d never do anything about it or try to . I just see it as a minor annoyance, I don t own the street and I m guessing the light issue is not something anyone who doesn t live here thinks about! We need our curbspace in front of our house. If someone parks there when we're out, it's annoying, but we deal with it. Because that's how it works. My sister lives in a townhouse with street only parking and all the neighbors believe the parking in front of their home is theirs only including my sister. They all get mad and tantrum if someone takes their spot. The street is an extension of the house for them. It s rather fascinating how from young to old they tantrum over it and obsess over it. If someone is in their spot they keep a lookout so the moment the person moves, they run out and move their car. Um do you not understand that she is the queen of your street? Maybe you are the real Karen, it s not that hard just do exactly what she wants My parents have a neighbor who would put nails in your tires if you park in front of her house. At first I thought it was always a coincidence but when my husband parked in front, he also had a nail in his tire. I recently moved out and never had a nail in my tires once. There is a crazy dude on the street near where I work. He thinks the same, and will come out yelling at people. The police avoid getting involved, but every once in a while some poor soul parks near his house. By me is a road with a modestly busy shop and restaurant night life scene and not much parking, and as such usually late at night Friday and Saturday people park in the surrounding neighborhoods. Now a whole road has these scary looking signs citing some bullshit city code telling people if they park in front of their yards saying they have the right to tow anyone who parks there cause it's their property. Honestly they don't have a right, but tow companies don't care at all here and will do it whether it's legal or not. Same here, our Karen who does this is an early 20s male. The street is HIS parking and no one better dare park there. My dad would move his car off his driveway to park on the street outside the next door neighbours house, all to save her parking spot while she went to work! My dad had copd and was very ill, he was constantly on oxygen and nebuliser machines and after moving his car in the morning could barely stagger back indoors. I told him how ludicrous the situation was when he could collapse in the street all for a parking spot. His neighbour had to be deaf, dumb and blind not to see how ill my dad was, cos he couldn t even string a sentence together without coughing and spluttering. Thankfully he stopped after I appealed to his pocket and asked him if he moved his car to the street and got hit by someone who didn t leave their details, would his neighbour help him pay for any damages considering his car was on the street for her sake. After mulling that one over he sent the neighbour a text letting her know he wouldn t be helping her anymore due to his health. Funnily enough no one parked outside her house anyway so she always came back to her spot!!! Our neighbor, Kevin?, made a stink about people parking in front of our house. When we had a babysitter he would harp about her car. I think it was ethnically motivated, as he would often comment about people with 'Spanish' names and she was from Venezuela. At first it was because she would park near his driveway although it was only a problem when he moved his massive boat and SUV , but then she started parking a little bit on our grass, and he was concerned the neighborhood image would be damaged. Meanwhile, anytime he has people over, they park in front of our house, and they often park a little on the grass. We put up some stones to stop it from happening. My former next door neighbor was like this. She'd pitch a fit if anyone parked in HER spot in front of HER house. But her family would visit and park in front of our house all the time. Thankfully, she's gone now, and the new neighbor is much nicer. We also had a neighbor two houses down pitch an absolute fit because my son in law parked on the street across from her house. There were no spots open in front of our house, or in our driveway we had five cars in the household at the time - five adults, four of us needed cars to get to our jobs and he was trying to avoid the crabby next door neighbor. According to the 2nd neighbor, if he parked across the street from her house and she had to have EMS come, they wouldn't be able to get past. Untrue. The street is more than wide enough for an EMS rig with cars parked on both sides of the street. This one got so angry that she'd start yelling at him whenever she saw him. Both neighbors were elderly. I'm in my 60s', and one of my life goals is to NEVER be that crabby elderly neighbor... My ex was highly territorial this way, even left a note on our neighbours daughters car when she visited them with her then toddler saying we couldn't park our car if she was there. I had to remind him a few times that I could easily have parked my minivan on the driveway if his POS classic car wasn't sat there rusting away instead of in the garage which he'd filled with his scooters mopeds , took a while but he finally shut up about it and stuck to grumbling to himself and glaring out the window at them. My parents live in a fancy neighborhood, with expensive houses with 2 car garages. And yet, it seems like every single car parks on the street instead of in their driveway or garage. It makes driving through the neighborhood a hassle. This whole thread is making me glad I live in the country. I've lived in so many places like this, it's utterly ridiculous. I remember one neighbour would put nails in your tyres if you dared park in front of their house. I am this person!!! I bought my house almost 25 yrs ago and have watched the neighborhood homes change from single family occupants to multiple renters. The older owners always respected the space in front of each home for the homeowner. I will ask newcomers to leave the space in front of my house open for my daughter that is a nurse and often works late; mostly not a problem. Had one house of young men that partied all the time, had a loud old corvette and a supped up Nissan Z. Snowed one day and I cleared the spot in front of my house and the corvette parked there after daughter left as another person commented, up north this is a no-no and I'm from NYC! . Spoke to him about not parking in front of house, he says it's public parking and can park anywhere. I said yes it is, and I can report you to the county for having lived here for 2 years without changing the registration on your car and you will then have to pay a fine and start paying personal property taxes. He nor his roommates ever parked in front of my house again. I once had a neighbor across the street whose son consistently parked in front of my house, even when there was plenty of space for him in front of their house. I discovered why. His car leaked oil and they didn't want the oil slicks to be in front of their house. I tried to be nice and asked them to not have him park his car there, but they ignored me. So, I started reporting the car to the police when it hadn't been moved in 48 hours. They kept getting tickets but he still parked there. Finally the city got tired of it and towed his car. I never saw it again. If you have a home owners association the neighbor may be right. My neighborhood, before moving to the country, if you park in front of a neighbors house on the street you would 100% be towed and you could park in front of your own house on the street only til dark then your car would be towed, we also were not allowed to park work vehicles outside in our drive way and even cop cars couldn t be parked in your drive way over night. I m so glad I never see my neighbors. Too many trees. Just tell her to have it towed easy peasy!! Except ope. Public road. Fk her. I cut a little slack for a 75 year old neighbor. I m fine with walking a few steps further. I ve got the time and energy. It s quite likely the Karen in question will need the space much longer. The only time this pissed me off was when someone parked to close to my mailbox and the mailman would skip my house. Or when they parked in such a shitty manner they took up enough space for 3 or more cars neighbors parking 2 cars way too far apart but not enough to fit cars in-between when normally can fit 4 cars there. Lastly if they blocked me in or parked in front of my drive or in my grass. We had some neighbors that had alot of teens over since they had a 17 year old son. I didn't care if they parked in front of my house but did if I missed my mail or worse couldn't get out or park at my own house. I was never mad at them, obviously it was the kids friends being dumb. Nice kid he would usually catch it but sometimes didn't and only had to go ask and they would move. My son has four cars - plus the other 3 me/wife/daughter have. We've got 3 in the driveway, 2 in front of our house and one in front of the neighbors on each side. Neither of them use that parking and since it is a public street there's not much they can do about it. My son knows we're not too happy with this car collection and we're pressuring him to finish fixing the blue Civic 1990 to sell. It s true though that so many assume the street is THEIRS. Like why??? You are the perfect neighbor and I hope you keep rockin and getting delicious goodies Cul-de-sacs tend to have the most creative parking solutions too. Your street is basically a round parking lot, and once folks have a system set up it can work really well. Wont you be....my neighbor I also live in a cul-de-sac. I m a bit territorial when it comes to the space outside my house as a my drive isn t big enough for two cars and b parking was a nightmare outside our old house think student land . Visitors always seem to park out side our house, even when there s plenty of other spaces. No idea why but it always seems to be the case. However, it s a public road. I have to suck it up every time. I moan about it. I have a good swear about it. But it s a public road so it is what it is. I m sure the extra 10 metre walk is good for me That is how it should be!!! Neighbors being neighborly. You ve got great neighbours. We came home from Christmas holidays to find all of our neighbours guests parked in our driveway. Not even an oops, our bad, when we went to ask them to move. Smart neighbors! Keeps a nice neighborhood. I have a neighbor like this, except because of how narrow the street going down is, people park half in the yard and my stretch makes up a solid half of the street their parties usually have ~30 cars it absolutely destroys the lawn which isn t the biggest issue, but growing grass here sucks and, thanks to the ditch, people get stuck. people also park at the top where people leave making no room aNd sometimes park in others driveways also making no room there s a golf course literally two houses down with a huge parking lot but they never use it We had neighbors like that for a while. We lived next door to a restaurant owner with an enormous family. We 'allowed' them to park in front of our house on the public street, hell we let them use our driveway if they asked. Huge Lebanese family, amazing food, excellent music that ended at 10PM exactly and they invited anyone in the neighborhood that walked by. Great family. The folks who moved in after? Less so. Yeah that s just bad human behavior at that point We have a dip for if we were to build a driveway we aren t going to because of several reasons preventing us and I park in front of it sometimes and I ve actually had someone tell me I was blocking the nonexistent driveway to my own home.. Like.. huh? Omg! Same. We only have on street parking and 3 cars can fit in front of our building. We all know this and park accordingly. We had a new guy move in a ross the street and we knew we'd have to jockey for the in front of house. But idiot parks in suck a way only 1 other car fits so 2 of us have to park way up street. Then leaves it there for a week It's obnoxious. You get there first, you get first choice. But c'mon Easily solved with a jack and wheel dolly. : Geez some people are entitled as fuck. I am so sorry you had to deal with them. Hopefully never again! Like we do park in front of our house but there s only room for our 2 cars. I bought this damn house and I am allowed to have as many friends as I want over. Street is 100% fair game Depending on where you live Im in NYC , that tree, with that sign, may not actually be hers. Any tree between the sidewalk and curb actually belongs to the city. You are not allowed to post on or alter them in anyway. I think its a crazy rule anyway. If the branches grow out the side and impede pedestrian walkway your not even allowed to cut them. I still do but its technically illegal. AND get this--- If that same tree, which is city property, has roots that cause your sidewalk to crack or lift up, is now YOUR problem to pay for. Those same trees than grow right into the overhead utility lines and cause nothing but trouble during storms. So, you may be able to fight that Karen with the same Karen power and report her for illegal posting on city property. deleted That s a new one I have many cats and lemme tell you they don t care even a bit. The birdies flying by get more attention I ve got a dog that goes nuts if anyone other than the neighbor parks in the street in front of their house across the street from us . Observant little dog. Im always a little nervous about that situation. On 1 hand I would love to say screw you I can park anywhere on a public street as long as it is legal. On the other hand, I dont want to have something done to my car and not be able to prove it was that house I parked in front of that did it. Yeah I mean I will gladly look up our town s policies if needed but I d rather just keep letting my friends park where they please and just avoid oldie karens if possible haha You have to be careful in a neighborhood though, look at who cleans off the streets, if it is a city truck it s public if it s a private company then the streets aren t public and you will 100% get towed no cops needed. Yikes! I m glad you got there when you did bc who knows what the male Karen Craig? would ve done to your car with a weapon-like item considering their overly crazed reaction when you approached em. People are insane!!! Geez your neighbor was totally inconsiderate. Not sure of the legalities with that since I know there are tons of rules and regulations for concrete and yellow lines and whatnot but I wonder if he could be fined? You almost had me in the first half ngl I m so glad you re not a bother to your neighbors! THE LIFEEE holy fuck !! Does she have something actually wrong with her brain?? Hopefully the cops laughed in her face and fined her for wasting their time. Definitely keep your distance from that looney tune Also shocked they re 22 and acting like that I was 22 when we moved here and would never even think of acting so crazy to someone anyone who bitches to park A BOAT is 100% entitled lol I ve seen people park boats at the side of their house in the grass or in their backyard. No way in hell do they need street parking for that luxury. Yeah i don t get why it is such a big deal to people I m glad you had the pettiness to make routine tho that s impressive I love it Thankfully this is our first home and we ll likely move in 3 years or so if the market becomes more reasonable. Now I know to make sure to live without neighbors I would post on FB but tbh everyone in the page is a Karen male or female because they re all old fucks who are mad at something small and benign Oh no that I totally understand and the company or whomever created the store should have made a plan for their customers to park. That s completely unfair to have customers take up public streets like that if the store is wildly popular. That s some dumb planning on their part! Sorry you and your brother dealt with that! Get together with some neighbors and block them in when they actually park in the driveways. Check local regulations first so you don t get in trouble. Talk to the store and explain if they don t do something about it, you will have them towed if their customers park in the driveways. Won t take long to hurt his business. Too realistic with the one in the right being calm and the wrong one going off with a cig Someone else said the same! It s a good idea I would if my friends didn t live so far! The one from yesterday is the closest at 10mins and the next closest friend is over an hour. Maybe a big friend sleepover is in order with like 8 cars parked everywhere I m shocked at how many Karens outed themselves in the comments of this post saying I m somehow in the wrong for a friend parking in front of my neighbor. Like no that isn t how that works lol Good! I m glad you re taking legal action because that s insanity right there. I never had neighbors before moving here so I keep to myself unless they say hello or ask me questions. I m not the type to willingly speak to them first because I keep to myself and such and wfh so i don t leave the house between 8-4 5 days a week Blocking a driveway is dicketry at its finest! Both myself and my neighbor don t have driveways so my Karen neighbor is just being a douche for no reason lol Exactly Exactly!! And these guys have no pets. Not saying it would change anything but I d be more likely to move out of courtesy if there were barking pups that got triggered by outside stuff I live on a street where everyone has at least 2 cars, some several. Parking is a pain sometimes, but no one argues. We have a one car driveway and a long driveway that goes back to the garage behind our house. A couple of them have cars they never use. I have actually offered them the use of my big driveway to make their lives easier. See I used to be a peacemaker but the world is falling to shit and I m tired of being used so I m done Woah what?? Why??? Like what is the benefit of that No common sense there I assume these guys are just old and don t have much to do than check their front security cam day in and out lol The first time they mentioned this weirdness was when we moved in and my dad parked his truck bringing my mattress and other larger items in front of their house because other moving trucks were in front of ours. They came out and started screaming at my dad big buff construction guy and I remember hearing it from inside and just watching my dad look at em, nod, and shrug before coming inside to greet me. Like it isn t that deep that you have to care and scream at others or ask around door to door who parked where. Get a life my guys! Did the police actually do anything? Bc if so that s sooo messed up I ll basically be doing the same minus the last line because personally I don t think Karens deserve more than one word replies anymore Ah okay thats different. I mean if there were spots in front of my house I'm sure my friend would've parked there she had a lot to carry too so it would've made sense . But since myself and my bf were parked there she took the next available slot closest to my house , which was in front of my neighbors. However, my neighbor owns 3 cars and has 4 parking spots they have in front of their house as well as the house next to them as that woman doesn't own a car so there was no logical reason to her freaking out over someone parking there. That's what's getting me about this bc wherever I look and whatever I try to use to rationalize - there just is nothing. No rationale behind her madness lol Exactly! They could install a driveway if they wanted to to avoid those issues but clearly they didn t so it s fair game I work from home so I don t usually move my car Might make my bf do it tho lol So i don t know if they re in their 70s or 60s. The wife is well enough to do long walks with her grandkids around the block sometimes and swim with them in their pool and the husband is 100% physically fit as he is always working on his wooden creations in the back and fixing up the shed. They re definitely not physically inept over their age, which is super impressive. Also the types of cars they own jeeps/trucks are high off the ground and require a quick jump to get inside so I don t think it s about them walking far or whatnot. If it was - I d definitely understand. Also the wife is well enough to run to everyone s door on the block and ask who parked there last night lol They both have jobs and are still mentally and physically well. I mentioned it in a previous comment. 70s was a stretch theyre more 60s Also, they have parking at the house on their side because that woman doesn t own a car so they have 4 spots vs. my 2 Our trash collection is Wednesday morning so no issue there The way that you assume my friend who parked there walked across their lawn vs. using the perfectly available sidewalk tells me all I need to know lol. We live in a clean suburb and there is no trash nor dirty lawns over - of all things - parking on the public street. It doesn t because I am not going to police where my friend parks. I am very much not in the wrong here since public is public. It also isn t like there isn t parking anywhere else near their home. lol It s not only technically not illegal, it is what I like to call perfectly legal and morally acceptable. Don t get so worked up over the rules to reindeer games when you are the only one playing. My g. Twasn t me who parked there and who am I to police a friend who is visiting? Get off the high horse and maybe this sub if you re sensitive to calling people Karens did you even read the post ? it was a visitor to the neighborhood and with no available parking in front of their house, friend parked in front of karen s house. in a perfect world, i m sure they would have parked at op s house. op wasn t purposely leaving the area in front of their house empty to inflict their cars, legally i might add, in front of the karen. I mean again, twas a friend who parked there and I m not about to tell my friend where to park when they visit if its a public road. Not exactly a dick move on my part nor my friend since she was unaware because she was just visiting for dinner. I m also not trying to be a good/bad neighbor - just living my life avoiding them usually. My neighbor is 100% allowed to try something with me but they don t know it was my friend and I m not going to randomly tell them bc I avoid people Apologies for you not understanding the post when everyone else seems to. Going around door to door and demanding to know whose car was parked for 3.5 hours outside of their house on a public street last night is extremely Karen-y Not sure how you don t get it? Yikes at that guy! Sorry you had to deal with him. Neither I nor my neighbors have a driveway, but my neighbors do utilize the house next to them older lady, nice, she has no car for their huge truck and then the other 2 cars they own go in front of their house. Personally, since the woman at the corner house has given them permission to park around her end, they also have the side street to park on and plenty of room whereas we only have 2 spots one for me, one for bf so my friends are totally allowed to park wherever Yeah my neighbors and I don t have driveways but they do have permission from the corner neighbor to park in front of her house since she has no car. So they have spots for 4 cars while only having 3 and we have room for 2 cars in front of us These people need professional help jesus Sigh sometimes logic just doesn t work. As long as she keeps her grump to herself and doesn t go around yelling at people for it lmao Luckily they are known around town as the ones with 24/7 cameras monitoring outside of their house so if they did that to mine or a friend's then everyone would know that they have video evidence of who did it and if they say no to watching the tape - then it's clear it was them. That's the benefit of them being known as videotaping oldies. Yikes No HOA. I was adamant about never moving to a house with one I ve definitely overestimated her age in the initial post. She s more early 60s considering how physically active she and her husband are It s also not me who parked there as I wfh so don t drive often. My friend parked there because it was an open and public spot and I don t police where others park thankfully Yeah it d be different if my friend blocked their driveway they dont have one or mailbox or whatnot but she parked normally. Parallel to the curb and close to my neighboring vehicle since none of their cars were currently parked at their residence. It was a short visit too so it wasn t like overnight or impeding on literally anyone. I think my neighbor just gets bored tbh People are weird about what they consider 'their' territory. Probably some left over ape wiring in our brains, if I had to guess. They are really awesome neighbors, too. The dad restores old cars. Whenever I need a tool to change out my car battery or fix something, I ask him and then he just walks over and does it for me in two minutes. When my house got broken into, their house was where I went while waiting for the police because there is always someone home at their house. It pays to be cool to your neighbors. In our neighborhood, we have a street that claims to be private property it's a dead end up a big hill with about 10 houses on 2 culdesacs . There's a great view up there, so I decided to walk my dog up it so we could explore and see the view, as we were new to the neighborhood. This guy came out and told us to leave as the entire residential city street is private property, apparently. I was nice to him about it, and I think he honestly felt bad, so he started mumbling something about break-ins. I told him I understood as I live in the same neighborhood although it's a safe neighborhood and we've never had any break-ins . He questioned me about where I live as if he didn't believe me. Like, guy, your street isn't THAT special a place. 0/10, won't be back. The one I'm still noodling is the snow one - where someone shovels out the snow over the spot to use later. I'm not sure why someone else bet that the spot stays free should affect me, but I'm not really sure. I think it s both a generational thing and maybe geographic. Younger folks can t afford a house so we would never think we own the street and here in the PNW we are over populated with little parking so it s a race to get a spot anywhere unless you literally pay for your spot and even then it s a toss up on whether it will be available. If I were you I d just say, I dunno to anything they ask or my favorite, can t know, didn t see That's such a weird thing to get mad about. The only time I have ever had an issue with it is when someone would park in front of my mailbox and/or trashcans so they end up getting skipped. Or when they actually block my driveway so I can't leave. Especially annoying when they do that and they aren't even using their own driveway... It pays to have a friendly relationship when things go south. About two weeks after my youngest was born, my mom came over so I could have my very first nap since the baby was born. I had been looking forward to that nap for days. I was recovering from a C-section, nursing and up every hour or two with the kid. I was blissfully asleep, with white noise machine going, windows shut, ear plugs in. Neighbor's adult son came screaming into the cul-de-sac in his loud pickup truck absolutely blasting his music. It woke me up. And it continued for about ten minutes. I lost it. Stormed outside, yelled at the guy, who was drunk as a skunk at lunch on a Tuesday. He yelled at me. We had a whole screaming match and we both stomped inside. My neighbor comes over the next day. Says his doorbell camera caught the fight. I'm so embarrassed. He's extremely apologetic. I'm apologizing. He comes in and snuggles the baby for a few minutes and he explains his son won't do that again. And I promise not descend on his family members like an avenging angel anymore. If you have a friendly relationship, it can survive even when you absolutely lose your postpartum sh*t on someone. Mama always said, 'You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.' Karens are full of vinegar and they wonder why they get treated the way they do. Oh, that sounds frustrating. I'm chill about it because we have solid cement curbs and sidewalks. So, when people park, they don't even walk in my grass. It gets a little tight when people park on both sides of the straight part, which is the intersection to the main road of the neighborhood. Just gotta watch your mirrors pulling through there. It's such a roll of the dice with neighbors. I'm sure you were sad to see the cool family go. We've gotten really lucky. Everyone is really cool. There's one couple across the street who put up a Griswold-esque Christmas display that played a midi version of Jingle Bells on a loop. I could hear it in my bedroom while trying to sleep. Was quickly going insane. Husband took a bottle of wine over and asked the dad to turn the music off. He happily agreed. The next week, I ran into the mom and she says, 'Oh, you're the one who hates Christmas.' Can't win 'em all. I absolutely agree! It's a shared resource and, as OP says, if you want reserved parking, then you pay for it and put it on your own land! Otherwise you can share with the rest of us. Wait sidewalks aren't city property? what the heck america? Uhm... no doll. Unless the street is restricted to residential i.e. owners / tenants parking only, there is no 'social contract' on parking on PUBLIC property. That's what a street is - public. Fun fact: the average NA suburban home doesn't actually pay enough in property taxes to fund the infrastructure needed to hook them up to civilization. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IsMeKl-Sv0 The publicly provided parking space in front of a given house belongs to the public and is quite literally subsidized by public. So the public can and should use it. You can t be for real if you don t have parking in front of your house your friend parks at your neighbours. The street is public property. Settle down. Shit. My dogs just go crazy when ANYONE parks anywhere within 12 square miles of my house... at least that's what it feels like anyway Public city street. AND a dead end. AND they had a driveway to park in. They were just dicks. I asked in another post a couple days ago about what the male version of Karen was called got downvoted too for asking, no idea why . I was told it is Ken. I thought Chad sounded much better though. I'm sure if I looked hard enough there would be two or nine city violations at his place...but like, then they would look at my house and yard and find something too lol. He's not a bad guy, I think the people who painted it just messed up. He will also shoo people away from parking across my driveway unless they are quickly loading/unloading a trailer or what not. It's OK if it's temporary and being half in my space and half in his is really the only solution to remain safe. I mean they didn't take anything she said seriously, didn't even ask me my name. She later claimed she only said that because she 'was told my husbands name was single' and she's a 'single mother who has to do what she has to do.' I just had to walk away. Those are the only 2 times the 911 call and 2ish months later that 'convo' i ever saw her face to face the entire like 10 months she lived above us. But yea, she legally has to keep her distance from me per the protection order i got against her Lots of people park their boat on the street around here, no problem with it. If a vehicle is registered trailers required registration you can park it on the street. It's a quiet area without parking issues generally. If you take your boat out, smart move is to park a car in the spot to stop someone else parking there. If not, chances are they will leave of their own accord and you just have to wait for it to free up. It was just the entitled way she asked on the community Facebookgroup 'does anyone know who this is and can you ask them to move' that got noses out of joint. It's the best way just be petty and they can't do nothing if it's taxed insured and has MOT. Best of luck with the next 3 years I don t understand what you mean. I m talking about the tv show called Neighborhood Watch, there have been a number of clips like you describe in your post. It usually ends with Karen going to jail. I had a neighbor who did the same shit to me. She came to my door the first time a friend parked in the middle of the day out front her house. Did it again a week later. Kept it up. Pissed me off. Parked a junker I had right out front and center of her house and left for work. By that I mean I left town for three months as I work on the road. I parked my two trucks in front of my own house as well. When I got back I saw her one day, waved and smiled. She never said a word. Hire a skip maybe and leave it there for a week? Get a long term permit from the city and park a moving POD in that spot for a few months. I WFH too and way to much time on my hands. Lol That s what I mean, unless she cannot physically leave then she needs to just get over it. It s funny that the generation with the most Karen s is the one that complains about how entitled everyone younger than them is, and cries about participation trophies. Fuckem, they should control their dogs. There is a line between being a good polite neighbor and putting up with nonsense from neighbours. The funny thing is the new house my parents are in has a real pain in the ass neighbor and he has already started shit with them. I am thinking that I might have to find a cheap car to park in front of his house just to make friends. Does it not damage his own car to push another? No they didn t do anything. They just talked to my in-laws about the situation that the neighbors were causing. The point being, if someone is having friends over to stay the night and they park their cars in front of your house Tuesday evening? I never assumed anything about you or your friend. The fuck are you on For what it s worth, it s a WAY bigger dick move to act like an idiot because someone parks in front your house than to actually park in front of someone s house. But yeah, neither you nor your friend made dick moves. I m just talking about the people who do it knowingly realizing it s going to upset someone else. Ergh, I live next to a pair like that now, luckily we all have drives so it's rarely an issue now. And we live in a cul-de-sac, they have no need for cameras. Don t take it personally. Your post was fair and you are clearly a treasonable person. But I reckon you would agree that your post triggered a whole bunch of semi- hysterical anger over some grouchy would be parking nag. Plot twist they're the ones who broke in I m not sure if this is what you meant But on east coast US, if you are the one that shoveled snow out of a space to park, that spot is considered yours the whole day even if you leave and come back They take it very seriously and will absolutely fuck your car up if you take their spot Western Canadian, I've seen streetfights over less. Well i kinda wanna tell her that yes i do know bc I want her to know that I m done enabling her lil rule about not parking in front of her house. Just because she doesn t have guests doesnt mean i wont Happy cake day! We were really sad to see that great family go, yeah. We ended up moving ourselves last year and by sheer dumb luck ended up with the kindest elderly couple on one side my kids baked them Christmas cookies because they thought they're so nice and a young teacher on the other. Dumb lucked into a neighborhood of cool families : One of the nice things about my HOA is that on the main web page it says that the streets are public and anyone can park there, even if it's in front of your house. They are but your responsible for maintenance. Not all streets in neighborhoods are public many neighborhoods own their streets and can make what ever rules they want as far as parking. If you live in a snowy area easiest way to figure it out is if city clears the snow it s public if a private contractor does the roads are private. Or dares to walk past your house? I ve got one of those. My husband and I both work from home so that little shit I take it back. I love him most of the time gets kicked out fast. This happens to, but let s just say we learned the hard way where I live one criteria to build a neighborhood is the streets have to be owned and maintained by the Neighborhood and costs for their upkeep included in the HOA fees. Chad for sure ! Ken? I know some decent Kens but not a single nice Chad Shouldn't it be Daren? Ah okay okay my bad I thought he did the work himself and all. That s different then. At least he tries helping you out! I love your style tbh. You handled it *chefs kiss* That s interesting. People around me don t have boats but I ve passed some near the beach towns down south that have biiiig boats on their lawn Hey I ve survived 2 with this being the only incident if you can call it that because nothing really happened Another 3 is a piece of yummy cake OMG I thought u meant the town watch like facebook page some towns have em . My bad, but that sounds incredible. I need to watch that show She 100% deserved it lol If she comes to my door I just won t answer bc I do not have the time to try and explain rational thought to a Karen Ehh if it becomes a prob I could I WFH but don t care enough to do anything more because I honestly forget neighbors are a thing didn t have any before moving here so I ll just keep a good response for if she dares approach me It was so funny bc someone earlier a Karen said I was the pot calling the kettle black and they went into a small tirade about how this generation has no respect. Like ma am or sir you just said that. On a FuckKaren sub Of course they deleted the comment and then their profile Honestly go for it. A nice clunker that s $500 or so just to bake in the sun in front of their house makes for nice decor tbh He manually pushed it a few inches on gravel. That s fine as there is plenty of parking elsewhere for me. But it s neither here nor there as this happened last night and my friend was here 3.5 hours for dinner Did you not just comment that on my post? I must be seeing things... But it's okay. This is the internet so feel free to continue going off but I won't respond. Get the anger out my g. Yeah no my bf and I personally don t park in front of their home even if someone is parked in front of our house because we know they will go off. But they aren t on my mind all the time so when my friend came to visit I didn t think about them bc who would lol I was just excited to see my friend and hang. Smh at my neighbors for making something outta nothing I mean the post might ve triggered some online people but not my neighbor themselves. Like I said in the post I don t usually engage in convo with my neighbors so she hasn t had a chance to try and question me or what have ya *cough*Philly*cough* Chicago calling in dibs Same, in Boston. Jersey here. If you park in the spot I just cleared of snow I'm going to shovel all that snow back around your car. Been there, spent hours shoveling 3 feet of snow. Some asshole pulls right into the spot as soon as I was done, I was not very happy. 100% will f you AND your car up in Chicago where I used to live in the Uptown neighborhood. removed Yep I would do the same. I had the same type of neighbor. I didn't cave into her nonsense 100%. I would do the exact same and seems like the most proficient course of action moving forward Ty! See. My HOA was opposite our streets were owned by the neighborhood and parking was very limited and specified. No parking in front of the neighbors house, no parking over night on the street, no more then 2 cars parked in the driveway and absolutely no parking any work vehicles with logos on them that could be seen you could park them in the garage but garage door had to be closed . I know one! He's a physical therapist, and a really nice guy. Before I met him, I did wonder if I would be able to talk to him without laughing - wondering if he was a ' typical Chad.' That s perfect. Why am I just hearing about Darren now? Much better than Keith or Ken or Kevin. Yeah, my neighborhood has Citizens Watch; I believe they get some training with the police. They walk the business district and some residential areas; the folks who volunteer feel their mission is to have a presence. Neighborhood holy crap, it just hit me it s Neighborhood Wars, not Watch . They show clips of neighbors behaving poorly. I explained it to her a couple times. The last time I thought I was really clear when I explained with just two words. Fuck off . Not answering the door didn t work. That shit box out front though, that made a statement! I was wondering what that deleted comment said! Clearly they didn t read the room I have a few friends that might be able to help me scrounge up some real eye sores just for the occasion. And what I m describing has happened multiple times with the trash truck refusing to touch my bins if I stick them in the street near the car due to liability. So several weeks I ve had my trash not collected due to the asshole parking in front of my house Maryland here and I d do the same thing. Hope they have a shovel. This is the way. I would go to jail over that shit. Next time... Put the snow back You're welcome. Heck if I know. It rhymes, and the name makes me picture an uptight dude with a plaid buttonup shirt and khakis. If I had one I d park there for sure Yeah it was kind of like a secondhand embarrassment thing because I just read their looong paragraph to myself and couldn t help but laugh and watch the downvotes commence. Hopefully they learned a thing or two I support this with all of what s left of my heart Kill the Karens with legal maneuvers like this and the world will be a better place That sucks but is a different situation than the one presented in the post as it was 1 . Not a trash collection day 2 . Friend did not stay the night lol Did I forget to mention the water I accidentally spilled on the snow around your car just before the temp drops for the night??? Doubtful, but we can hope Highlights one of many reasons people may have an issue with it is all I m suggesting You re lacking reading comprehension and making this All About You, when clearly it is not. Deal with your own issues with your own neighbors, and stop making them someone else s issues, when clearly *they re not the same thing at all*. Yeah but these guys have plenty of room other comments I made state they have their house and the one next to them since that woman doesn t have a car and they freak out unnecessarily because there s plenty of other parking and no trash collection. I would understand if the situation you explained was the case, but it just isn t. Thank you bc I thought I was losing my mind repeating myself Right?! I m reading the same fucking thing over and over and thought, am I taking crazy pills? Beyond the normal amount?",

This may be acceptable, but she has gone up to people's cars and yelling at parents, she's called and harassed the principal, protested online, even tried for a lawsuit once, I believe. My dad has encountered her on a hunt for prey, she went up to his car, knocked on the window to lure in the quarry, then striked, yelling at him and going crazy over him daring to bring his child home from school. My dad escaped with his life, and she's still hunting.",

I live on a private road next to an elementary school and the street has signs saying private road, no school access , and the parents who use it for school parking are horrendous - we ve asked people to move, siting the legal sign, because we have a delivery coming and they are blocking access and get cursed at. A lot of parents use the street as a means to cut the line, so we have issues during drop off/pickup of parents allowing us access to our street blocking the entrance/exit so people can t get out or in . It s incredibly frustrating to not be able to leave or come home during those times, and I have to schedule appointments around it, leave for work earlier, etc. School pickup/drop off creates Karen s on both sides for sure. Wow. Don't like dealing with pickup lines? Don't live near a school. When are people going to realize public streets do not belong to them. There is always an idiot that thinks they own everything. Or just stupid like the ones that buy a place buy a dump and complain about the smell or by the airport and complain about the planes. I live in a city that s near an airport. There s a group of Karens that occasionally get riled up about the noise from incoming planes, as if the jets belong to said airport or something. They literally document every flight they consider too loud, and file regular complaints with the FAA. They also regularly schedule meetings with the FAA and they all insist that the agency really listens to them. I think they figure that they can shut the airport down or make them silence their airplanes or something. What s funny, is if you really debate one of them, they have all these proxies like it scares my kids or it freaks out my pets , noise of that level is harmful , or even claims of chemical contamination. But when you point out how ridiculous that is, they get defensive. If you ask them if it s just that they don t like the sound, they blow up and double down on their pet issue. Road near me every morning and evening it's packed with cars on school runs.few have almost come to blows with the residents trying to get in or out of there driveways.,council sent parking wardens out and told people to move..that was a fun watch Carry a spray bottle of water. Roll down the window and spritz saying 'Bad kitty' until yhe misbehaving stops. Worked with my cats. my friend made the mistake of buying a corner house, and didnt know it was a bus stop. every morning two dozen kids were on her lawn at 7am being loud, tossing candy and chip wrappers all over her lawn, etc. always know what ur getting into buying a home Her behavior sucks. Sounds like she has completely lost it & is burnt out. She should reevaluate her approach to the car line. Her problem with it is probably deep rooted in a history of asshole entitled parents but it doesn t give her the right to yell at people doing no harm. Car line parents are the worst. Our school s car line parents have doubled parked, parked in No parking zones, park blocking the buses, tried to go between the busses and got his car stuck, hit the crossing guard because they don t want to wait and so much more. I have seen so many accidents in the car line. I would hate to live by my current school s car line but if I did I would probably just record everyone and post it. When we moved I purposely didn t buy a home by a pickup area because my old house was by one and the parents picking up their kids sucked. Absolutely no respect for people s property. After 30 years living across from a school I kinda understand. Even if you discount the air and noice pollution. Both kids and parents are trashy, as in they litter both on the sidewalk and on peoples yards. Multiple times have I witnessed parents dump their cigarette butts on the sidewalk. Or cars get on top of the curb where there is not sidewalk and break the sprinkler heads of my neighbors. I ve never yelled at anyone or contacted the school but I have been known tho run my leaf blower when I see a parent litter from their car. I agree that this is a total Karen. However, the scene before and after school is ridiculous because kids can t walk home or take the bus like normal people. Hence big long lines of idling cars in peoples neighborhoods twice a day. Not really that lovely either. It reminds me of when I lived in NYC and people would move there and live on top of bars and restaurants... and complain it's too loud. Yeah, no one likes noise, but it was YOUR choice to move here! It was Karen's choice to live near a school presumably . If she doesn't like it, she should move instead of fighting against 'immovable forces' like an imbecile. I live in a small 4 house cul de sac with a high school one mile away, a middle school 15 feet away, and an elementary school 6 blocks away. Yea it s annoying as shit when people are all in our neighborhood at once to pick up kids, but that s the price you pay for living near good schools. People pull into our cul de sac all the time to park to pick up or to turn around. I don t like it but I don t do anything about it. Question- are the parents allowed to use the street? Are people blocking driveways and the travel lanes. There has to be more to the story here. School pickup is the worst though. When did this become a thing? When I was in school graduated in 2007 this was not a thing. Now I have a kid in kindergarten who takes the bus home, but the pickup line is over an hour long. I would never get in that line. I can't imagine having nothing better to do with your day than sitting in line. Who are these people? Do that many people really not work at 2:45 in the afternoon Monday thru Friday? Start screaming get away from the kids pervert! Embarrass her enough that she won t come back. This was happening at out local grade school too - turns out the women who was freaking out about parking had her driveway blocked for an extended period of time and couldn't get out for an emergency her Mother was in hospital and then passed after an accident . She has been making this her hill to die on and frankly, I don't really blame her. That said, I only know all this through our local Facebook group because my own kids are grown ups. If they re blocking her drive, I can understand her frustration. I lived by a park that had a huge lights festival at Christmas and I d have to make people move because they block the entrance to my street and driveway. If they aren t blocking anything, she s just a grumpy Gus. Sounds like a prime candidate for pepper spray. 100% go to the police and file an assault or harassment charges! She wants attention. Don't give it to her. Does the school have anyone for security? He/She could hang out where she normally does her thing, and I'll bet it would be easy enough to spot her. If I was one of those parents I would invest in an air horn Tabasco sprayed in the eyes is a deterent if she knocks on your window you could just pepper spray her I would call the cops, this is harassment. Get a restraining order slapped on this weirdo. Also, she is hanging around an elementary school, report her as a potential pedophile. Is there some reason children no longer ride school busses? The Karen is correct ld be pissed at lazy parents to idle to walk their kids to school it's different if they work l do not blame the woman one bit for having at go at stupid inconsiderate parents Take a fake revolver and point at her when she approaches others Now in the movies: Karen predator vs dad I had David Attenborough in my head doing the last bit. Roll up blaring music xd Call the police non-emergency line, tell them what she s doing, and request an officer to keep an eye on her. She s escalating. Take pics and/or videos of the offending Karen. This will enrage her further. I live across the street from a school. Traffic is bad in the morning and afternoon but I don t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into when I bought house. I do wish the kids would litter less but that doesn t seem likely. Part of me doesn't blame her - long lines of idling cars outside elementary schools for 10-15 minutes twice a day are a pain in the ass, on top of pollution and noise. Incredibly annoying to the other 99% of the population. Taxpayers pay for actual school buses that go door to door - don't you wish you had a bus that went from work to your front door! - and people won't use them because of scheduling inconveniences. I have a genuine question about school pickup lines and why there are no school buses? I am Canadian and live in Australia now, and every single school here is just a line of cars picking up their kids at every school, every day. High school, elementary school - I have never seen a school bus in this country. I don't ever recall anything other than school buses or walking home from school when I was attending. A few parents would come get their kids if they had to, but nothing like what I see here. School pickup is 2:30-3:30 and drop 7:30-8:30 i believe. Don't most of these parents work etc? How can they commit to drop off and pickup every single day? Is it legal to carry paintball guns in your vehicle in your jurisdiction? But not the spray. Mace, the medieval weapon Yes. Pepper spray, and a mace. I d go for a cattle prod. At least the cow would recognize it quickly enough to back off Thanks for the advice I honestly thought this was where this story was going and was disappointed Not mace, fart spray. Nah. Take it one step further and use bear spray to tame the wild Karen. :/ *The slow way.* or you could just pepper spray the problem and show her the way of the world. Self defence is OK, but protecting your family from her is a must. Then compile the videos and cut them in a way that makes her sing 'my neck, my back' and put it on Facebook Our daughter's school had a small park opposite, on which 4x4s would regularly park. One summer the council fenced it off, so they began parking on the verges, across driveways, and quite often in the sterile SCHOOL-NO PARKING zone. Then one glorious day a minibus full of parking attendants turned up. They issued dozens of tickets, the reactions to which ranged from pursed lips to a screaming fit. How I laughed as I walked her from our house 300 yards away. How she giggled when she heard her classmates' mothers using naughty words. There was a house that went up for sale on the car line street in front of my kid's high school. I just cringed every time they were showing it during car line. It's like the worst of humanity on display. Most of us are sitting there reading or listening to podcasts and sometimes sleeping, but some people are just awful. They block the drives, they get into fights over people cutting in line, the are so. damn. loud. The whole thing could be managed in a civilized way and so much less invasive for that neighborhood but some people can't just eat a snack and act right for twenty minutes. You could do what a friend's neighbors did when I was in school. The school pick-up parents would block a private road and the driveways all the time. The cops told the people that lived there that since it was a private road, there was nothing the cops could do. Given that information, one of the residents with a large 4x4 got together with the other residents of the street and agreed to block the road once it was full of pick-up parents. The parents screamed and yelled and eventually called the cops. The cops came out and said he had to move the 4x4. Several residents came out and told the cops that the town had to pick one, either the cops could force someone to move or not, and that they had an attorney ready to help the town make the decision. The entire time this was gong on all the pick-up parents were blocked in. Some weeks later an agreement was signed allowing the cops to ticket and tow on that street. Sounds like hell, honestly. You knew there was a school there when you moved in? Sounds like it's time to put a gate up. I think it's reasonable to be annoyed by people blocking drives, knocking over trash cans, throwing butts in your yard, etc. It's not like car line behavior is known for being civilized. And this is from someone who is in the car line. the same day when they also discover common sense and courtesy, neither of which i ever see happening Facts the streets don t belong to them, BUT I very regularly see people block residences driveways for school pick up and not care or even park in residences driveways. Durant sound like this Karen has that excuse but some people are assholes picking up their kids when the HOA implodes I disagree with this, for instance my parents bought a house on the outskirts of my home town so they could enjoy having fields in front and behind the house. 7 years later a primary school is built directly in front of the house and parents park on their garden, blocking the driveway etc. they re rude and think they re entitled to park anywhere because it a a public road without any common courtesy for the local people who ve had their countryside privacy stolen. Did you miss the part about it BEING A PRIVATE ROAD? When are you going to realize that private streets are not public property? Or did you just reply to the wrong comment? Yeah, pretty sure that school was there when she moved there. 'Turn down your planes! My tomato-sized poodle doesn't like it!' My house was the bus pick up. I guess my dogs scared the kids because it s now up the street. They're by the curb on one end of the road, so it's pretty easy to get out of your driveway. It's a suburban street, and I've never really seen anyone drive down the road during car-pickup, but you can still drive your car through. This is exactly what they hate. We played the game where a crazy lady was invisible. It wasn t mature but neither was her tantrum. The school recently hired a police officer, and I'm pretty sure it stopped now. Yes. Some kids live too close to the school for bus pickup. When my kids were in school, that was a two mile radius. I m not letting my kid walk that far on busy streets. That s why parents take their kids. Funding - Several districts in our area only use them for special education needs now because it s required legally . Everyone else has to walk or be driven. We must be more than 2 miles away. HS must be 2.25+ miles away. A lot of kids live in a 2 square mile radius The majority of kids live too close. Some school districts where I live don t offer buses at all. You get a ride or walk. I disagree and I do not respect your opinion. Many parents live too far to walk and too close for a bus, and most parents do have work. Either way, it's also no excuse for some of the things she's done. Also, learn some grammar. lol The thing is, most kids who go there apparently live too close to be able to use the bus. Looked it up, apparently no. ! gif giphy QqkA9W8xEjKPC A headache on a stick. Can I substitute for a flail? Wielding a mace correctly inside my car would be kinda tricky. Or mace the powdered aromatic spice, pinch in your hand and good blow and she will get the message. I can reduce people to a fit of sneezing. https://www.thespicehouse.com/blogs/news/what-is-mace kind of relevant simpsons https://frinkiac.com/meme/S07E17/183950/m/IElmIHRoaW5ncyBoYWQgdHVybmVkCiB1Z2x5LCBJIGFsd2F5cyBoYWQgbXkKIG1hY2Uu Or Ma$e the rapper And my axe! nice mace covered in pepper spray is a great deterrent And mace the spice. The trifecta. And a trebuchet. Don t spray mace in your vehicle. I was downwind, outside. It was not pleasant My favorite is the BLARING music where every other word is fu*k and ho and the n word and bit*h and c*nt and a$$ etc. Windows open and the whole street shakes as we have little kids hearing those words for 20 minutes. You want to listen to music that loud, not much I can do. But why must we subject people to those words so loudly and constantly. IDK Yeah like putting your kids on the bus? When we moved in, buses were still being used. That changed two years later. It got much worse when the district cut bus services, and then cut crossing guards. I feel for our again, private street, no school access neighborhood, but also feel bad for the parents - it s a minimum 45 minutes of traffic in the morning and afternoon. I would hate to be in the drop of line. But, I d also keep access open for the people who live on the street, which a lot of parents refuse to do per my additional comment . Why can t these delicate little flowers ride the bus? I mean, fair enough. Bad behavior is frustrating, but the original post didn't mention driveway blocking. It must be really frustrating for your parents, but towns and cities change over time. New stuff moves in, areas develop. I know that not everyone has the option to sell and move, but it's something to consider. My family is in ranching. We've had property taken through eminent domain because of an encroaching city. We eventually had to move the entire operation to another county. It sucks. My family had that land since the Texas Revolution. But that's life. I was replying to the original post. I don't see anything about it being a private road. Sounds like this woman is fed up with having to rearrange her day for the school. That s part of the reason I sold my house. They built a school close by and trying to get out of my neighborhood became a challenge twice a day. You were more mature. Karen was the child. You did the right thing. I always look at it is if you engage in the tantrum it just fuels them more. Good news! And some schools do not provide busses as the students live too far from one another and the school, as is usually the case with private schools. My son I as distance learning, but his former school has a driver shortage, so they are doing two separate bus runs. To accommodate, the first bus run group has to be at the pick up location a full hour earlier than usual, making pick up times around 6-6:30am. It's still dark and the weather is miserable. NO way would I make my son experience this. Thank you everyone for the answers. I appreciate you taking the time. It s been a long time since my kids were in school and I really had no clue what the possible reasons could be. Two miles is definitely too far for an elementary school child to walk. When mine were little, it was a four block walk/bike ride to their school and it was in a small town, not a city. When they got older the bus came and got them since the middle and high schools were built out in the country rather than in town. Well, that s disheartening. I shouldn t be surprised though. We don t even pay teachers what we should, so it s not really surprising we don t fund the childrens transportation costs appropriately either. Two miles is entirely too far for elementary age students to walk. If that had been the case when mine were that age, I likely would have driven them as well. Thank you for your reply. ETA - Wait. It s considered ok/safe for a first grader 6 years old to walk two miles but for a 17 year old senior the cut off distance is only increased by 1/4 of a mile? How is that acceptable? Seems if they want to use a two mile radius as a cut off point, that should be for the older students. For the younger ones it should be far less. Good grief. No wonder parents drive their children. Is that the mace or the Karen? Apply directly to the forehead But a flail would be fine? The fuck kind of car is it you can swing a flail but not a mace? Bring a Morningstar when dropping the kids off in the AM for school No, a mace is definitely handier inside a car. A flail is much more suited to get around shields, blocks and armour. Maces excel at close-quarter fighting with their short shafts It s not called the right name N O T R E L E V A N T See, now you re getting it. Your car would BE the trebuchet. One of my relatives was producing a junior theatre production, one of the kids turned up without an audition song prepared and so sang I want to bend you over the back seat whilst playing it on YouTube via her mums phone! I never hear words, it's mostly just bass. Only once have I heard someone blasting classical. It s like the volume is inversely proportional to the quality of the music No one is sitting in car line because it's fun. Oh my God! Why didn't I think of that *Honey- get in here! Did you know about this??*
